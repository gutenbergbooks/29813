<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has always been my favorite theory,
that the goodness and beauty of a truly
Christian life in children could be taught
quite as effectually by combining the gay
with the grave, as by being altogether
grave; for I chanced to remember that I invariably
omitted all the latter portions of the
story-books bestowed upon me when a child;
and I have reason to believe that human nature
is pretty much the same now as then.</p>

<p>In each of these little stories, it has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
my single aim to inculcate a desire in children
to <i>do</i> good, to <i>be</i> good, and to seek
prayerful assistance from the One source of
all goodness&mdash;their Father in Heaven.</p>

<p>And now one word about the sixth book
of this series. Trembling with a deep responsibility,
I have ventured to write a fairy
story, (that enchanted ground for the little
ones,) through the whole of which I trust
this thread of my theory has run <i>unbroken</i>.
It is the last of our little friend, Lame Charley;
and if the dear children who have made
his Nightcaps theirs, will bear him, and me
for his sake, in affectionate remembrance, it
will gladden the heart of their loving</p>

<h2>BIG NIGHTCAP LETTERS.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE FIRST LETTER.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, when all the children, after
the usual frolic with Crocus the cat and the
<span class="smcap">tremendous dog</span>, had settled themselves for
their "nightcaps," (their meaning of which
word, of course, you all know,) the little
mother cleared her throat, and paused, for
she was feeling for a letter that was in her
pocket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Something particularly good is coming
to-night," whispered George to Anna.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see how bright her eyes are?
See! now she is hugging Charley, and kissing
him;" and unable to resist this loving
exhibition, he rushed from his seat to hug
and kiss Charley, too, and ask him if he felt
quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Charley thanked him with a loving look,
and George went back to his seat, all in a
glow.</p>

<p>"Children," said the little mother, "I received
to-day a letter from Aunt Fanny!
She says you have given her so many delightful
stories, she thinks it is quite time to
give you some in return."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="302" height="400" alt="THE FRIGHTENED OLD BACHELOR." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE FRIGHTENED OLD BACHELOR.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever!" exclaimed the children,
eagerly. "What a perfect bird of an Aunt
Fanny! How perfectly delightful!"</p>

<p>"She wishes me to ask how you would
like her to send you each a story, that you
would know had been written especially for
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh! what a capital idea!"
cried all the children, clapping their hands
at such a rate, that an old bachelor opposite
opened the window and looked out with a
spy-glass, to see where the fire was; and
nearly frightened a lamplighter into fits, who
was just at that very moment lighting a
lamp at his door.</p>

<p>This most delightful announcement made
the children chatter so fast, that Charley became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
nearly sick, laughing at what they said;
for George again called Aunt Fanny a "perfect
bird!" and Harry improved it by exclaiming
that she was a perfect <i>cat</i> bird!
which, of course, meant something very complimentary.</p>

<p>"Won't she write stories like a <i>mice!</i>"
cried Johnny.</p>

<p>"And won't mamma read the writing
like a precious kitten!" said Clara.</p>

<p>"Well, I never knew kittens could read
writing before," laughed Harry.</p>

<p>"But, mamma," said Anna, "the letter
looks very thick; is the first story in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the little mother. "I will
read what Aunt Fanny says&mdash;she says&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, dear children, what do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
think? Do you remember the story of the
'Doctor' in the first Nightcap book? Well,
that very doctor is now a young lady; and
she has written a story on purpose for our
dear little Charley. I think it is very charming;
and I have sent it for the very first one,
because I well know this will best please his
loving brothers and sisters. Sarah, (the <i>real</i>
name of the 'doctor,' you know,) has tried
to write what would most gratify Charley's
sweet and tender nature." Here the little
mother stopped, and kissed her lame boy,
and the children murmured, "dear, dear
Charley." Then she read on&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will perceive that Sarah has endeavored
to imitate the beautiful German style.
Here is her story. Give Charley a kiss for
us both before you begin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>And in almost breathless silence the
mother read the title&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'><br />"THE LITTLE WHITE ANGEL.</div>

<p>"Some children stood in a group before
the door of the village school-house one
lovely summer evening.</p>

<p>"They were all talking pleasantly together,
from Kline, the son of the rich and
proud Hoffmeister, to little blue-eyed Carl,
the only child of the poor baker.</p>

<p>"It is very true that Kline wore a velvet
jacket, richly embroidered, while Carl's coat
was old, and his wooden shoes were rough
enough, in all conscience; but what of that?
If they were good friends, what difference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
did <i>that</i> make, I should like to know? Wait
till children become grown people, for pity's
sake, before you expect them to measure
each other's worth by what they possess or
wear!</p>

<p>"'The new schoolmaster, Meinherr Friedrich,
comes to-morrow,' said Otto. 'I am
so glad. I was weary of that old Master
Hoffman, with his crooked problems and
hard lessons.'</p>

<p>"'So was I, truly,' cried Kline, who, although
a good merry boy, hated his books as
he did medicine.</p>

<p>"'Ah, thou didst always like play better
than work, my Kline,' said Max, 'and so do
I. Meinherr Friedrich will be wise if he
keep me and thee apart during school hours;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but come, see which can get home first&mdash;one,
two, three!' and away they all scampered,
laughing and shouting as only schoolboys
can.</p>

<p>"The following day, the boys were all
standing around the schoolhouse, when the
door opened, and Master Friedrich himself,
appeared, and cried in a cheery, hearty voice,
'Welcome, my children.'</p>

<p>"'Welcome, master,' cried they.</p>

<p>"And now they entered and took their
seats, and were quite still while the good
master read a short chapter in the Book
of Books; and then reverently kneeling,
prayed that the dear Jesus would guide him
in his teachings, and bless them, and send
His Holy Spirit to watch over them all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"School began; the thumb-worn books
were brought out&mdash;the lazy boys began to
sigh and frown, and wish impatiently for the
recess, and wonder why Latin dictionaries
were ever invented; when, as if by magic,
they found themselves listening to the pleasant
voice of Master Friedrich, and actually
understanding their lessons, so clear and simple
were his explanations; and the time for
recess came, to their great astonishment,
long before they had expected.</p>

<p>"When the studies were over, the master
drew from his desk a box; and whilst the
children gathered around, he opened it and
drew out charming little pink-and-white seashells,
pretty pictures, and many other beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
things, which he gave to the children,
with loving words.</p>

<p>"But the most lovely thing of all, was a
little porcelain statuette of an angel. She
stood, so fair, so pure&mdash;with her small white
hands folded upon her breast, and her eyes
uplifted, that the children gazed enchanted.</p>

<p>"'Oh the dear angel! the beautiful angel!'
cried they all. 'Wilt thou not give
it to me, Master Friedrich?'</p>

<p>"But the good master smiled, and said&mdash;'The
little angel is too lovely to be given to
any boy who is not good and true of heart.
We shall presently see who shall deserve her.
He who brings me, to-morrow, the brightest
thing on earth, shall have the angel.'</p>

<p>"At this the children looked at each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
other, as if wondering what the good master
might mean; but he said no more, and they
went home thoughtful.</p>

<p>"The next day, after the lessons (which
had now become so pleasant) were finished,
the children clustered around the master to
show him what they had brought.</p>

<p>"Some of the smaller ones had picked up
sparkling stones on the road, and as they
held them in the sunlight, were sure they
must be something bright and precious.</p>

<p>"Some had polished up a shilling, until
it shone like a little crown. Heinrich
brought a watch-crystal, which his father
had given him, and which he considered a
wonder of transparent brightness; and Kline,
the rich Hoffmeister's son, had brought a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
paste buckle, made to imitate diamonds, than
which, in his opinion, nothing could be
brighter.</p>

<p>"All these things were laid on the schoolmaster's
desk, side by side. The shillings
shone away famously, the pebbles and watch-crystal
did their best, but Kline's buckle
was the bravest of all.</p>

<p>"'Ah! mine's the brightest!' shouted
Kline, clapping his hands.</p>

<p>"'But where is little Carl?' said Master
Friedrich. 'He ran out just now.'</p>

<p>"All eyes were turned to the door, when
presently, in rushed Carl, breathless. In his
hands, held up lovingly against his neck,
was a poor little snow-white dove. Some
crimson drops upon the downy breast, showed
that it was wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh! master!' cried Carl, 'I was looking
for something bright, when I came upon
this poor little white dove. A cruel hawk
had wounded it, and I caught it quickly,
and ran here. Oh! I fear it will die!'</p>

<p>"Even as he spoke, the dove's soft eyes
grew filmy; it nestled closer in Carl's neck,
gave a faint cry, and died.</p>

<p>"Carl sank on his knees beside the master's
desk, and from his eyes there fell upon
the white dove's poor broken wing, two
tears, large and bright.</p>

<p>"The master took the poor dead dove
from his hands, and laid it tenderly down on
the desk with the bright things; then raising
Carl, he softly said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My children, there is no brighter gem
on earth, than a <i>tender, pitying tear</i>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"The boys were silent for a moment, for
they felt that the master had decided that
Carl had rightly won the angel, and then
Kline cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Nay, master, thou didst not fairly explain
to us. I pray thee give us yet another
trial.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, dear master,' said Max 'give us
one more trial.'</p>

<p>"'What sayest thou Carl?' said Master
Friedrich.</p>

<p>"'Yes, dear master,' answered the generous
boy.</p>

<p>"The good master smiled thoughtfully,
and his eyes rested for a moment, lovingly,
upon Carl; then glancing round, he said&mdash;'He
who brings me the loveliest thing on
earth to-morrow, shall have the angel.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"The children clapped their hands, and
departed satisfied.</p>

<p>"After school, the next day, Kline was
the first to run up to Master Friedrich, and
lay upon his desk what he considered the
loveliest thing in the whole world&mdash;his new
soldier cap, with the long scarlet feather, and
bright golden tassel. Max came next, and
placed beside the cap a small silver watch,
his last birthday gift, with a bright steel
chain attached. Otto brought a great picture-book,
just sent him by his godmother;
Rudolph a tiny marble vase, richly sculptured;
and so on, until a still more motley collection
than before lay upon Master Friedrich's
desk.</p>

<p>"Then little Carl stepped modestly up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and placed in the master's hand a pure white
lily. The rich perfume filled the room; and
bending over the flower, and inhaling the
delicious fragrance, the master softly said&mdash;'My
children, the blessed Word of God says&mdash;Consider
the lilies of the field, how they
grow; they toil not, neither do they spin,
and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. Carl has rightly chosen.'</p>

<p>"But murmurs arose; the children were
not satisfied; and again they asked for
another trial. And as before, good Master
Friedrich inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What sayest thou, Carl?' and he answered
as before, with generous haste, 'Yes,
dear master.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Now this is the last time,' said the master.
'He who brings me the <i>best</i> thing on
earth shall have the angel.'</p>

<p>"'The very best thing on earth is plum
cake!' cried Kline, on the third day, as he
walked up to the desk, bearing a large cake,
richly frosted, with a wreath of sugar roses
round the edge. This he placed triumphantly
before the master, sure of the prize.</p>

<p>"'Nay, thou art wrong this time, Kline,'
said Max. 'I asked my father what was the
very best thing on earth, and he laughed,
and gave me this golden guilder; the prize
is mine.'</p>

<p>"'Ah! but <i>my</i> father said that the very
best was a good glass of Rhenish wine,' cried
Otto, 'and I have brought a bottle of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
thirty years old; the prize is surely
mine.'</p>

<p>"So they went on till all had placed
their offering before the master.</p>

<p>"'And thou, Carl?' said he. 'What
hast thou brought which thou thinkest the
best on earth?'</p>

<p>"A crimson flush rose to the little boy's
forehead, and coming softly forward, he took
from his breast a <i>small, worn Testament</i>,
pressed it to his lips, and then reverently laid
it down with the rest as he said, in a sweet,
low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My mother, dear master, says that
God's precious Testament is far before all
other possessions.'</p>

<p>"''Tis thine, my Carl!' cried the master,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
snatching the boy to his breast. 'The white
angel is thine! for there is nothing in the
wide, wide world half so precious as the
blessed words of Jesus;' and he placed the
angel in the hands of the trembling boy.</p>

<p>"Kline knit his brows, and gazed with
anger and disappointment at the little Carl;
and the rest, seeing him do this, felt themselves
aggrieved; but suddenly the cloud
cleared from Kline's face, and rushing forward,
he caught Carl in his arms, crying&mdash;'Forgive
me, dear Carl! now I am right
glad thou hast won the prize!'</p>

<p>"Ah! the blessed effect of a bright
example! Quickly joining hands, the children
danced joyfully around the little Carl,
who stood in the midst, the white angel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
pressed to his breast, his fair hair falling in
curls on his shoulders, and his blue eyes full
of holy tears.</p>

<p>"The good Master Friedrich also wept
for joy, and prayed, from the depth of his
pure and simple heart, that Jesus would bless
this lesson to the children's everlasting good.
He had turned away that none might perceive
his tears.</p>

<p>"But One in heaven saw them, Master
Friedrich."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The story was finished, but no one spoke,
for the tears were softly falling from Charley's
eyes; and the rest of the children, with
quivering lips, were gazing in his face. At
last he said, in a low voice&mdash;"What a lovely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
story! and how sweet and good little Carl
was! Dear mamma! we will all try to be
generous and good, as he was; and we all
know what a precious book the Bible is. I
love Carl; and I thank Aunt Fanny and
Miss Sarah with all my heart, for writing
this beautiful story about him."</p>

<p>And now all the children, with subdued
and tender glances, kissed their dear mother
and Charley, and went quietly to bed, thinking
of the dear little Carl, and wishing
softly to each other, that their mother had
thought of asking <i>them</i> to find the "brightest
and loveliest and best thing on earth," for
they hoped they should have done just as
the dear Carl did.</p>

<h2>THE SECOND LETTER.</h2>

<h3>HEEDLESS HARRY.</h3>

<div class='center'><i>For Harry.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harry:</span>&mdash;I have happened upon
an odd story of a heedless namesake of yours,

did, either in the vegetable or travelling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
line. Once, when you were a very little fellow
and were visiting at a cousin's house in the
country, you busied yourself all one morning,
pulling up radishes, eating the roots, and
then setting the tops back in the earth, and
when the gardener came to gather some for
tea, he found them all wilted and flat to the
ground. Do you remember how you had to
run for it, when he caught sight of you
laughing at him? and how his having the
rheumatism in his knee, so that he could not
move fast, was all that saved you from a
good thrashing? <i>I</i> do. So here is the story,
and hoping it will be very serviceable in
helping you to "mend your ways," I am
your loving</p>

<div class='center'><br />"HEEDLESS HARRY.</div>

<p>"'Oh! how I do hate to write exercises!'
exclaimed Harry, one Monday afternoon in
the summer time; 'what's the use? they
are abominable!' and he stamped his foot
and threw down his pen, clapped his hat on
his head, and rushed out of the front door.</p>

<p>"No wonder he was called 'heedless'
Harry; for he was so thoughtless, that he
never stopped one moment to reflect, when
he set about doing any thing, whether or
not it would get him into trouble; and consequently
he was always in some scrape or
other. He was old enough, certainly, to
know better, and pleasant enough, in other
respects, to be liked very much by all who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
knew him. He was full of fun, perfectly
fearless, and bore an accidental scratch or
tumble like a man. But, dear me! what a
heedless, careless little scamp! That very
morning, before school began, his mother had
sent him into the garden to gather vegetables.
He cut the carrots so that they would
stand up on end, and with great onions began
knocking them down, as if they were
tenpins; then he had a game of jack-straws
with some small slender beans, and ended
the vegetable business by stringing a dozen
red peppers and tying them round the cat's
neck, making her sneeze her head nearly off;
for the poor thing went 'tchitz! tchitz!
tchitz!' for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"When he was tired of laughing at her, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
marched away to skip stones in the brook,
and ended by slipping on the bank and tumbling
into the water, and treating himself to
a very thorough ducking.</p>

<p>"Harry lived with his parents on a large
pleasant farm, about twenty miles from the
city of New York. He had never been in
New York; and this afternoon, at which my
story commences, when he rushed to the front
door, he put his hand in his pockets and said
to himself: 'I've a great mind to run away! I
know I shall catch it to-morrow, about that old
exercise, and I can't write it. I won't! now!'</p>

<p>"He walked to the fence, and climbing
up, looked over into a neighbor's meadow.</p>

<p>"A beautiful white horse was quietly
grazing, and lazily switching the flies off his
back with his long and silken tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Halloo!' exclaimed heedless Harry,
'there's Lightfoot! Jolly! what a chance
to go off on my travels! I'll catch him.
There! now he is drinking out of the brook.
I'll go and jump on his back.'</p>

<p>"As usual, the little scapegrace had entirely
forgotten that the horse was very swift
and spirited, and also that he did not belong
to him or his parents. So Harry, with one
bound, jumped the fence, paying no kind of
attention to a great thorn which tore down
the leg of his pantaloons for half a yard, ran
up to Lightfoot, caught him with one hand
by his flowing mane, placed the other on his
back, and tried to mount him.</p>

<p>"Horses are animals, but they are not
stupid or fools for all that. So Lightfoot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
while he kept his nose in the brook, had been
quietly watching Harry out of the corner of
his eye; and when the young gentleman tried
to jump on his back, the horse gave a quick
little start to one side, and a knowing flourish
with his tail, which sent Mr. Harry plump
into the brook for the second time that day,
and then Lightfoot scampered off with a
neigh which sounded remarkably like a horse
laugh.</p>

<p>"The angry boy scrambled up the low
bank like a lame grasshopper, and screamed
out, 'You hateful old thing! I <i>will</i> get on
your back! see if I don't!' So he cut a
stout branch from a tree, stripped it, made
it whistle through the air, and with a spiteful
chuckle advanced once more upon Lightfoot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"The horse gave another neigh. Harry
approached him softly, hiding the whip behind
him, smoothed his neck, and patted his
side, and then, with a sudden spring, leaped
upon his back.</p>

<p>"Lightfoot stood perfectly still. Then
Harry clucked his tongue against his palate
to coax him to go.</p>

<p>"But the horse pretended not to hear
him. 'Get up! Get up!' cried Harry.
'Come now, get up, I tell you.'</p>

<p>"Lightfoot went on eating, as if there was
nobody within a mile of him.</p>

<p>"Harry became more and more impatient;
he thumped the horse with his knees,
and drummed with his heels, and finding
that did no good, he raised the switch, to
strike him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lightfoot was a 'cute' Yankee horse, he
wasn't 'raised' in Vermont for nothing; so
when he caught sight of the switch, he
ducked his head, and off went Harry like a
flash of lightning, and found himself sprawling
on the grass.</p>

<p>"You would think that was enough; and
that Harry, after all these gymnastics, would
go home like a boy that had some sense
pounded into him by all these hard knocks.
Not at all. Up he sprang, ran to Lightfoot,
and jumped for the third time upon his
back.</p>

<p>"'Get up! Get up! you goose!' he cried.
This time the horse heard him, without any
doubt; he gave a nourish with his long tail,
cleared the fence with a bound, and rushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
down the road like an arrow shot from a
bow.</p>

<p>"And now our young friend would gladly
have dismounted, but that was easier thought
of than done. To get off a horse in full gallop
may not be difficult, if you are not particular
whether you come down on your
heels or your head. Harry reflected, that
though possibly his head might be harder
than the stones in the road, and the stones
would be hurt the most, yet there was rather
a chance that the stones might crack his
head instead, so he concluded to hold on if
he could.</p>

<p>"On dashed Lightfoot for miles and miles,
with Harry clinging for dear life to his neck
and mane. At last they approached a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
town, and Lightfoot stopped of his own accord
at a public house.</p>

<p>"Out came the landlord, staring with
surprise, and lifted Harry off, half-dead with
fatigue and fright, while the hostler led the
horse to the stable.</p>

<p>"After the heedless boy had washed his
face and brushed his clothes, he felt better,
but desperately hungry; there was no fun in
that; so he concluded to hunt up a dinner.</p>

<p>"When he entered the dining-room, the
people looked at him from head to foot. Of
course this was because they were admiring
him, he thought; so he drew himself up, and
putting on an air of dignity, as if he was a
gentleman on his travels, he said: 'I want
my dinner. Bring me a beefsteak, some potatoes,
and an apple-dumpling.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"At these words the landlord advanced,
put his hand on Harry's shoulder, and said:
'Who are you?'</p>

<p>"Harry preferred eating to talking just
then, so he answered: 'Give me a beefsteak
directly. When I have eaten my dinner I
will tell you my history.'</p>

<p>"'Um! we'll see&mdash;tell it to me this instant,
or you may get your dinner as you
can, like a gipsy under a fence&mdash;but you
won't have any here.'</p>

<p>"'I will have it,' cried Harry, in a rage.</p>

<p>"'You shan't!' said the landlord.</p>

<p>"'I will!' cried Harry.</p>

<p>"'John,' said the landlord to the waiter,
'I forbid your bringing any dinner to this
impertinent little scamp.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Impertinent yourself!' screamed Harry,
nearly beside himself with passion; and
he seized a glass to throw it in the landlord's
face.</p>

<p>"At this riotous noise, some more servants
and the landlady rushed into the room;
and the latter screaming out, 'You little
wretch!' and snatching up a broomstick,
rushed full tilt at Harry, who, concluding
that it was best not to wait for the fight,
jumped over the table, darted out of the
door, and flew up the street.</p>

<p>"He ran for a long time, as if a mad dog
were after him, until he had gained the outskirts
of the town, and stopping, breathless
and exhausted, began to reflect upon his
situation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"We always make remarkably wise reflections
when we are suffering from our misconduct.
Harry began to think he had been
acting very like a donkey, and would very
willingly have returned home, and taken to
studying his hated lessons.</p>

<p>"Night was now approaching; the twilight
deepened and darkened; and it was
only by the stars which came peeping out
one by one, that he could see his way. A
strange feeling of dread and loneliness came
over him, and he was rejoiced at last to see
dimly before him a large barn. Jumping
the fence, he went up and tried the door;
fortunately it was open, and our heedless
friend was glad enough to throw himself
down on a heap of fragrant hay, and spite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of his hunger, was soon in a dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p>"The dismal screech (for it isn't crowing)
of one of those long-legged Shanghai
roosters, awoke him just as the dawn was
streaking the sky; and shaking the hay from
his dress, Harry went out into the road
again.</p>

<p>"He was walking along, wondering
whether he should ever see home again. A
market-wagon came up behind him, and he
turned to inquire his way.</p>

<p>"'Where do you come from?' said the
market man. Harry told him. 'Bless my
wig!' said the man, 'you can't get home to-day,
no how you can fix it. Come with me.
I'm going to York to sell my sass, and to-morrow
I will take you half-way home.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Jolly! that's a good fellow,' cried Harry,
brightening up, 'and you'll be a better
fellow yet, if you'll give me one of these rosy-cheeked
apples; I'm hungry enough to swallow
the horse and wagon.'</p>

<p>"'Massy sakes! air you? Well, eat one
out each basket. 'Twon't make any difference;
they don't count apples.'</p>

<p>"So the heedless boy went into the apple-eating
business with all his teeth; and before
he had made a finish of it, they had crossed
the Jersey City ferry, and rumbled into the
streets leading to Washington Market, where
the market man speedily disposed of his fruit
and vegetables, which he called 'sass.' When
he had concluded this business, he took Harry
down into one of the cellars, where he ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a nice breakfast, and strange to say,
Harry had some inside room left, for he did
his part in clearing the plates in fine style.</p>

<p>"After that, they went to a public house,
where the good market man left Harry, as
he had some business in a distant part of the
city; but he charged the boy on no account
to leave the house till he returned. Harry
promised he would not.</p>

<p>"When he was gone, Harry put his nose
out of the window. The day was clear and
beautiful, and at the end of the street he
could see the water.</p>

<p>"'Dear me,' said Harry to himself, 'what's
the harm of going to look at the water. It's
a real ocean. I've never seen the ocean. I'll
just take one peep and come back.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Down he went to the edge of the pier,
and sat upon the end, to stare around him.
A steamboat coming quickly alongside, one
of the waves she made flew up in Harry's
face, and splashed him from top to toe. He
jumped up in such a particular hurry, that
a sailor on a large ship on the other side,
burst out laughing, saying, 'Are you afraid,
Mr. Sugar Candy?'</p>

<p>"'Afraid! I!' cried Harry, indignantly,
and turning round suddenly, his foot tripped
against a stone, and he tumbled over backwards
into the water.</p>

<p>"Harry opened his mouth to bawl, but
instead of that, had it well filled with salt
water. The sailor ran faster than a lamplighter,
jumped in the water, caught Harry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by the collar, and dragged him on shore, and
set him down in the sun to dry.</p>

<p>"While Harry was drying, the sailor
asked him all manner of questions, and soon
had his whole history. Then the cunning
fellow invited him to dinner; and heedless
Harry, delighted to get on board a great
ship, went with him, never thinking again
of the kind, generous market man.</p>

<p>"And now, boys, and girls too, read for
your benefit what happened next. The old
sailor was commissioned to find one or two
cabin boys for his ship, which sailed that
very evening, as soon as the tide served.
Harry was strong and quick&mdash;Harry was
fearless&mdash;Harry had run away from home&mdash;Harry
wanted to see the world&mdash;Harry was
the boy, the very dandy, for a cabin boy; so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the sailor proposed that Harry should continue
his travels in his company.</p>

<p>"'Where are you going?' said our young
friend.</p>

<p>"'To Senegal,' said the sailor.</p>

<p>"'And what sort of a place is Senegal?'</p>

<p>"'Senegal,' answered the sailor, 'is a
most magnificent country, where the rivers
are made of milk, and the mountains of sugar.
The rain is composed of lemonade, and the
birds fall down from the trees all stuffed and
roasted, ready to eat, from morning till night.
The trees are covered with sugar-plums; and
all the streams are full of goldfishes, which
come when you whistle to them. They are
real gold, and used for money by the inhabitants!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But&mdash;do they ever <i>write exercises
there?</i>' asked Harry, with a cunning twinkle
in his eye.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Never!</span>' cried the sailor, who saw
what the trouble was with the silly boy.
'The king of this delightful country has expressly
forbidden it. He has burned down
all the colleges and blown up all the schools.'</p>

<p>"'Jolly!' cried Harry, snapping his fingers,
'that's the country for me! I'll go
with you, sure pop!'</p>

<p>"You perceive that heedless Harry did
not use very elegant language, but as a true
historian, I must tell you of persons, places,
and things just as they are, and I hope your
good sense will teach you to avoid all such
vulgarities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sailor, taking advantage at once of
Harry's delight in his account of Senegal,
carried him to the captain, and making an
awkward bow, said: 'Captain, here is a new
hand.'</p>

<p>"'Good!' cried the captain. 'He looks
strong. I hope he won't die of weariness
and fatigue, like the other ones.'</p>

<p>"At these words, Harry began to feel
rather uncomfortable. 'What!' said he to
the sailor, as they left the cabin, 'do boys
have to work on board your ship?'</p>

<p>"'Sartain, for sure; all the time,' said the
sailor, laughing.</p>

<p>"'I want to go away,' cried Harry, already
disgusted with the maritime service.</p>

<p>"'What's that you say?' shouted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sailor, with a mocking air. 'You forget, my
fine friend, that I gave you a dinner; pay
me for it.'</p>

<p>"Harry shook his pockets, they were
empty. 'If you can't pay, you must stay,'
cried the sailor, and just then the ship left
the harbor.</p>

<p>"The heedless boy burst into tears.
Alas! sorrow and repentance came too late!
It was only now that he remembered his
father and mother, probably made ill with
grief at his disappearance; and the worry
the good market man must be in, thinking
the boy to whom he had been so kind was
lost, perhaps murdered, in the great and
wicked city.</p>

<p>"In the midst of these doleful lamentations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the sailor came up and pulled Harry
by the ear.</p>

<p>"'Come, you sniffling booby! go to
work,' he said.</p>

<p>"Harry looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"'My eyes! do you think you can eat
and drink for nothing? Come, take this
broom; do you hear?'</p>

<p>"Our dismal friend took the broom, and
would liked to have broken it over the head
of the brutal sailor, but he was not strong
enough.</p>

<p>"'Will you go to sweeping or not?' cried
the sailor, swearing in the most terrible
manner.</p>

<p>"'I don't want to sweep,' said Harry.</p>

<p>"'Don't want to?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"'No!' Harry, perfectly red with anger,
threw down the broom, and crossed his
arms.</p>

<p>"'Oh! that's the way you behave, is
it?' said the sailor. 'Come to me, Susan.'</p>

<p>"With that he caught up a knotted
rope's end, and gave Harry half a dozen
blows over his shoulders. You see blows
from Susan were given rather more frequently
on board ship than sugar plums.
'Now, my dear friend,' said the sailor, 'this
is only the beginning of your fun. Now,
you know what will happen if you are idle.
Susan is my wife, and my name is Jack Bowsprit;
so take care of Susan and Jack, and
pick up the broom and sweep the deck, if
you don't want some more of our delicate attentions.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Harry began, to sweep with a
trembling lip, his heart swelling with rage
and misery: then he had to wash the decks,
and after that to scrape the carrots and peel
the potatoes, and then he was rewarded by
having a piece of salt pork given him for his
supper, and eating it with the sailors.</p>

<p>"Harry was in despair. When supper
was over he came up and sat on the deck to
think. Tears came thick and fast as his misconduct
and its miserable consequences rose
up in his mind. He knelt down for the first
time since he had left home, and prayed his
Heavenly Father to forgive him, and promised
that if he only was permitted to see his
dear parents again, he would indeed be an
obedient, thoughtful boy: he would try to
be so from that moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Meanwhile, a fair, keen breeze rose, and
continued for many days, and the ship sailed
swiftly on to her destination. In a month
more they beheld Senegal. Entering the
river, they soon came to Saint Louis, where
they landed.</p>

<p>"You can imagine how rejoiced Harry
was to set foot once more upon the firm
earth&mdash;not with the permission of the captain,
though: for fearing they might keep
him on the ship all the time, in the dusk of
the evening he slid down a rope that was
hanging over the side, and, scrambling on
shore without being seen, made the best possible
use of his heels.</p>

<p>"Liberty is a very fine thing; but some
other things are wanted besides to make it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
perfect&mdash;dinner, for instance, and a house
containing a comfortable bed to sleep in.</p>

<p>"Harry was not much afraid at first at
finding himself in a savage country, alone
and unprotected. To the heedless, whatever
is new is charming.</p>

<p>"It was now bright moonlight, serene
and still. Harry, exhausted and tired with
his flight, lay down on the luxuriant grass.</p>

<p>"At home, lying down in such a bed
would have given him so severe a cold in
his head, that he would have nearly sneezed
and snuffled it off. Not so in Senegal. Still
there were other inconveniences, for Harry
had not rested for five minutes, when he
heard a stealthy footstep; his heart began
to beat. He had learned in his Geography<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that Senegal was full of wild beasts, as well
as the sugar plums the treacherous sailor
talked about. He began to wish he had
staid in the ship; but if he returned, there
was Jack Bowsprit, and there was <span class="smcap">Susan</span> as
sure as a gun. It is no doubt very disagreeable
to be devoured by wild beasts; but then
again it is very painful to be beaten by a
Susan. Harry was sure of the beating if
he returned, and he was not quite sure of
being eaten up if he remained; so he concluded
to stay.</p>

<p>"While he was cogitating all these things,
he heard again the same stealthy tread; and,
in a moment, he saw in the bright moonlight
a jackal, about the size of a big dog.</p>

<p>"Our heedless Harry was without weapons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of defence, but he was by no means
without courage. Up he sprang, seized a
large stone, and flung it at the jackal; at almost
the same instant the wild beast leaped
at him and bit his leg.</p>

<p>"Both gave a howl of pain at the same
moment. Happily, Harry was not much
hurt; while the jackal, with another cry,
lay dead at his feet.</p>

<p>"Harry gazed at his fallen enemy, his
heart beating with excitement; he could
not help thinking that if any thing a quarter
as bad had happened to him at home, his
kind mother could not have found caresses
and court-plaster enough to console him;
and here he was, alone, and wounded. He
went to a stream near by, and washed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tied up his leg as well as he could; and then
he began to think how he could pass the
night without danger. To rest on the bosom
of the earth was not safe; another jackal
might come after the first to help him pick
the bones. To be sure he might regain the
ship&mdash;but <span class="smcap">Susan</span>!! At last he concluded
he would leave the earth, and climb a tree.
After much toil, and terrible scratching and
scrambling, he managed to get into an immense
tree, and settling himself in a fork
like an arm-chair, he fell into a troubled
sleep.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="271" height="450" alt="THE ANACONDA THAT HARRY KILLED." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE ANACONDA THAT HARRY KILLED.</span>
</div>

<p>"The first rays of the sun awoke our
hero. Just as he was about to descend from
the tree, he heard a slight noise above. He
looked up, and there he saw (oh! oh! what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
I hope you may never see except in a Menagerie
or Barnum's Museum) an enormous
boa constrictor, at least fifty feet long, suspended
from the top boughs of the tree,
twisting about. With a fierce and horrible
hiss, which froze the blood in Harry's veins,
he twisted, and turned, and looked at the
terrified boy.</p>

<p>"Harry screamed aloud. He had read
of this dreadful monster, how he thought
nothing of swallowing a bull whole for his
breakfast; and, of course, our young friend
would be only a side dish&mdash;a mere trifle.
The boa advanced towards him with another
dreadful hiss, which seemed to say&mdash;'Here's
a nice little mouthful! wait for me.'</p>

<p>"But Harry was determined to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
one desperate attempt to postpone the feast.
He slid down the trunk of the tree like
lightning, and when he stood on the ground
he did not stop to ascertain which way the
wind blew, but ran like a rail car, under full
steam, panting and screaming very much as
they do.</p>

<p>"All at once he stopped short, for a terrible
roaring, like an immense peal of thunder,
shook the earth. What was it? Oh,
mercy! it was a great lion who was just
waking up.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="350" height="270" alt="THE LION." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE LION.</span>
</div>

<p>"What was the luckless, heedless boy to
do? Between the lion and the boa constrictor,
Harry was certainly lost. Whichever
was to eat him, it was certain he would make
a breakfast for one of them; for on turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
his head, he saw, to his increased horror, that
the monstrous snake had followed him; and
at the same moment an enormous lion appeared
running, making bounds as high as
the arch of a bridge.</p>

<p>"Harry threw himself on his knees. For
one moment he was a prey to the most agonizing
despair. Then he clasped his hands together,
and implored for pardon for all his
faults; and then rising, with a white and terror-stricken
face, he endeavored to await
with fortitude the coming of his cruel fate.</p>

<p>"But now a very remarkable thing happened.
Harry, nearly petrified with amazement,
saw the lion and boa advance with
savage fierceness upon each other!</p>

<p>"Oh! then he thanked God in his heart!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
He carefully crept to one side, and watched,
with an eagle-like glance, what would happen
next.</p>

<p>"With a wild roar and savage bound,
the lion sprang upon the serpent, and tried
to tear him in pieces, while the boa, hissing
like a thousand geese, twisted himself, fold
after fold, round the body of his enemy, crushing
him, squeezing him, and rolling over till
his bones cracked. The angry roar changed
into a cry of despair and frenzy. Soon that
cry became weaker and weaker, fainter and
fainter, then ceased altogether&mdash;the lion was
dead.</p>

<p>"The monstrous serpent, without waiting
to lay the table, or call for mustard, licked
his prey all over, and then swallowed him
whole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will ask, perhaps, why Harry did
not run away. He had two excellent reasons.
The first was, he did not know where
in this part of the world to run; he might
find a tiger at the very next turn; and the
second, that he was too frightened to move.</p>

<p>"So Harry stood by and witnessed this
ruthless, shocking spectacle, to the end, his
heart beating as if it would leap out of his
breast; and when the boa had finished his
frightful meal, the poor little fellow observed
that the monster was so gorged, he could
scarcely move, and that in a few moments
more he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"'There is one good thing,' he said to himself,
'the awful thing don't care to breakfast
twice, so I am safe for the present.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"As the boa seemed perfectly helpless,
he conceived a splendid but bold idea, for
he was by no means a timid child.</p>

<p>"He approached and stamped upon the
tail of the reptile, who remained immovable;
then he made a cord of a vine that was growing
near, with a running knot at the end,
and slipping this round the boa's neck, and
drawing it with all his might, he strangled
the serpent.</p>

<p>"Hardly had he concluded this brilliant
achievement, when he heard the galloping
of horses. Terrified and trembling, he waited
half in hope and half in fear for what was
to come, when in a few moments, to his great
joy, he beheld some officers of the marine
service, whom he was sure were Americans,
approaching him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was their astonishment at seeing
a little boy standing, pale, and with eyes
wild and distended with excitement, over
the dead body of an enormous snake.</p>

<p>"'Good gracious!' exclaimed the one
who appeared to be the captain, 'what on
earth are you doing with that amiable creature?'</p>

<p>"Harry, with his eyes full of tears, simply
told his history.</p>

<p>"The officers were very much affected.
They belonged to an American ship of war
that was just about returning home.</p>

<p>"'Would you like to go back with us?'
said the captain, kindly.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Captain!' cried Harry, 'gladly
will I go with you, but&mdash;'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But what?' asked the captain.</p>

<p>"'I want you to promise me that I shan't
be beaten by Susan.'</p>

<p>"'What on earth do you mean?' cried
the captain, as he and the rest burst into a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Harry explained how Jack Bowsprit
used to beat him with a rope's end, which he
called his wife, Susan, and how he hated Susan
worse than poison.</p>

<p>"They all laughed again at this, and the
captain promised that Susan should be
thrown overboard as far as he was concerned,
and that he should be taken safely home.</p>

<p>"So Harry went with the officers, who
treated him as if he was their son; and after
a prosperous voyage, he arrived safely at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
New York; and money was given him to
get home.</p>

<p>"That very evening Harry stood once
more before his sorrowing, almost broken-hearted
parents. What did they do? They
did not utter one word of reproach; they
just opened their arms, and the boy flung himself
upon their breasts; and amid tears and
blessings all was forgiven. But not forgotten.
Oh, no! for Harry, once so heedless, tried his
utmost to correct his faults, and with God's
help, he <i>succeeded;</i> and now he is so steady,
industrious, and obedient, that it is almost
impossible to believe that he ever was called</p>

<div class='center'>
HEEDLESS HARRY."<br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There was many a roguish, laughing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
look cast at Harry as this strange story was
being read; and when it was finished, George
exclaimed, eagerly&mdash;"Oh, mamma! what a
pity Aunt Fanny did not know about Harry,
and the old black cook, and the dishcloth!
Wouldn't she have laughed?"</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, Harry, do! do!" cried
all the brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The children knew the story as well as
Harry, but they delighted to watch the
sparkle of his eyes, and his animated gestures,
for to tell the truth, he <i>did</i> enjoy mischief
beyond words to describe.</p>

<p>"Well," cried Harry, jumping up, "you
see I <i>would</i> go down in the kitchen and teaze
the cook; and she could never touch me
with the broomstick, because I ran full tilt;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and she was very fat, you know, always trod
on her dress, and sometimes came down flat
on her nose.</p>

<p>"Well, one day she said&mdash;'If you come
in the kitchen again, I'll pin the dishcloth
fast to your jacket!' I <i>came right back</i>.
'<span class="smcap">Pin it</span>!' said I, 'that's all I want.' So she
pinned it, and I stood very, <i>very</i> still till it
was done. Then I made one jump in the air,
and gave one tremendous shout, and put
<i>square</i> up stairs for mother's room, the cook
after me; but I ran fastest, she was so fat.
I got in the room first, tore off the dishcloth&mdash;her
best dishcloth&mdash;bran new, and threw
it into the very middle of the fire; and she
had the pleasure of seeing the last of her new
dishcloth blazing up the chimney. So that's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
what a cook gets when she pins her dishcloth
on a boy."</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands, and
screamed with laughter at this story; and
they laughed still harder, when Harry put
on a comical, half-provoked look, and added,
"But you know mother made me take the
very money I was going to buy a new ball
with, and buy a yard of crash to make
another dishcloth for the cook; that crashed
<i>me</i>, so I don't think I shall burn any more
for the present."</p>

<p>And now the children, bidding each other
"good night," went skipping and dancing to
bed, delighted with the evening's entertainment,
wondering who would have the next
story from Aunt Fanny.</p>

<h2>THE THIRD LETTER.</h2>

<h3>POOR RICH LITTLE EVA.</h3>

<div class='center'><i>For Anna.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Anna</span>:&mdash;I have lately been reading
a book full of pure and beautiful thoughts,
called "Vernon Grove," and the other evening
I became acquainted with the authoress.
She is a most lovely lady, dignified and
graceful; and I had a very delightful conversation
with her about books.</p>

<p>In Vernon Grove there is a short story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
about a dear little girl, which story interested
me so much, that I asked permission
of the authoress to copy it out for you.
Here it is, somewhat enlarged and altered,
but the main parts just as she wrote it. I
know, dear Anna, it is exactly such a tender,
sweet story, as will most gratify your affectionate
heart; so it is yours, with a kiss
from your loving</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Aunt Fanny.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />"POOR RICH LITTLE EVA.</div>

<p>"On a curtained bed, in a darkened chamber
in the city of Charleston, not many years
ago, lay a beautiful lady, pale&mdash;almost dying;
but, oh! how happy, for her earnest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
prayer had been answered, and God had at
last given her the blessing of a child, and
the little tender life was even now nestling
soft as a rose-leaf in her bosom.</p>

<p>"It was late in the sweet spring-time,
which in that southern country is so beautiful.
A hushed and joyous stillness reigned
in the house, but every lip was smiling, from
the good old black cook, who was 'so grad
missis ben got her heart's desire,' to the
funny little fellow with his wool standing up
in kinks all over his head, who ran of errands,
and who evinced his delight by walking on
his kinky head all about the yard.</p>

<p>"Never was baby more welcomed. A
daughter, too, just what her parents desired&mdash;a
darling girl to be a companion for her
mother all day long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"The nursery was now the most interesting
and delightful room in the house.
Though evidences of boundless wealth and
exquisite taste were in every part, until the
baby came, it was only a grand, silent, gloomy
mansion; for no young pure voice had awakened
the echoes in the stately halls&mdash;no little pattering
feet made there delicious heart-music.</p>

<p>"But <i>now</i> what a magic change! How
friends flocked to see the wonderful nursery
which the expectant mother had been so
happy in preparing; how they peeped into
the bureau drawers, and admired the piles
of rare lace and snowy lawn, which were to
enfold the delicate limbs of this favored
child.</p>

<p>"And then the surprising and splendid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
toys in gold and silver! the beautiful pictures
already hung upon the walls, painted by
skilful artists, telling stories that she would
understand almost from infancy, of 'Little
Red Riding Hood,' 'The Lamented Babes in
the Wood,' and 'Little Mary and her pretty
pet Lamb, who <i>would</i> go to school with her.'
Ah! what a beautiful world was to be opened
to the sight and mind of that sweet spring
flower.</p>

<p>"Every day the good doctor came to see
the mother and the little baby, and every
day the mother grew stronger; and the
greatest delight of both parents was to look
at their new child, and softly kiss its tender
cheek, and feel the velvet touch of its precious
little hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, very soon, it grew so knowing,
and showed such surprising quickness, far
beyond (the <i>parents</i> thought) of any baby
ever seen or read of since the beginning of
the world. Of course it was very red at
first, but then the red was such a beautiful
shade. It hadn't the least speck of hair;
but what of that? There was a lovely expression
about even the <i>back</i> of its head;
really quite intellectual.</p>

<p>"Very soon, it would start at an unexpected
noise or touch, and if dinner did not
come at the very moment it was wanted, little
Eva (for that was her sweet name) could
cry in a manner to astonish you; but then,
such an excellent cry! so loud and strong,
that it was certain she had splendid lungs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
And what more could a mother's heart desire?
And her precious treasure was watched
and guarded night and day by a mother's
love, stronger than death.</p>

<p>"But what is this? The good doctor
watches little Eva as she grows, and always
when he looks at her, a sad, strange expression
comes over his face; and one day, when
going down stairs, he paused, and turned to
go back, but did not, for he said aloud to
himself: 'Not yet; they cannot bear it yet;
and perhaps, after all, I may be in the
wrong.'</p>

<p>"They were both so happy&mdash;that young
father and mother! How they pitied all the
poor married people who had no children!</p>

<p>"But the next day after this the good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
doctor decided not to withhold the communication,
whatever it might be, from Eva's
father and mother. As soon as he entered
the room, he said abruptly: 'Nurse, bring
me the child.' He stood by a window, and
threw wide open the darkened blinds. The
little Eva was brought to him just from her
morning toilette, fresh, sweet, and pure as a
rain-brightened flower; her long embroidered
dress sweeping the carpet, and soft lace nestling
about her tiny arms.</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear doctor!' exclaimed the
young mother, 'do not take the baby there!
That bright glare of light has dazzled even
my strong eyes; and how can her feeble
sight endure it?'</p>

<p>"'It is necessary, madam,' replied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
doctor. He seemed to be a cross old fellow,
but beneath his gruff manner was hidden a
great, kind heart.</p>

<p>"He took the child, and having sent the
nurse away, turned from the mother, who lay
anxiously watching him. He gazed fixedly
at little Eva, while he exposed her beautiful
and tender eyes to the bright glare of the
morning sun. His brow was contracted into
a great heavy frown, and a short but deep
sigh escaped him; but he never took his
eyes from her face: then he forced the lids,
with their long silken fringes, far away from
the ball of the eye, and little Eva was now
screaming with the pain caused by this
rough and cruel treatment. Alas! a deeper
shade of anxiety crossed the doctor's face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and the hard and unfeeling man, as the
weeping mother thought him, drew the infant
tenderly to his breast, and murmured
in a low tone, '<i>Poor little thing! poor little
helpless thing!</i>' and gave her back to her
nurse, and went away without saying another
word.</p>

<p>"That same evening the doctor came
again. It was very unusual for him to come
after dark, and his great creaking boots and
rough manner would have broken in upon a
very pretty group.</p>

<p>"But he went softly up stairs, and looked
in the room, unseen himself. There was the
happy mother wrapped in a cashmere, and
half-buried in an immense arm-chair, with a
sweet motherly look upon her face, watching
her darling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Close to his wife, Eva's father sat, holding
her in his arms; and, wonderful to tell,
for a <i>man</i>, holding her quite comfortably; for
he had lulled her to sleep with a lullaby of
his own composition, the language of which
was utterly unknown to the rest of the company.
He was learning to talk 'baby talk,'
and was really getting on very well, and
just now he was looking extremely proud
and happy at his success in soothing the
little one.</p>

<p>"Opposite to these happy parents sat
Mr. Vernon, a noble-looking gentleman, and
his wife, a beautiful lady, uncle and aunt to
the baby; and, in the distance, was the
faithful black nurse, old Dinah, fast asleep,
and quite as happy, in her own opinion, as
the rest of the party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Presently the father laid the baby tenderly
down in her beautiful cradle, and while
gently rocking her, said softly: 'I wonder
what the baby was thinking about while I
sang to her?'</p>

<p>"'She looked so wonderfully wise,' said
the mother.</p>

<p>"'Did you ever come across that lovely
little poem&mdash;"What is the little one thinking
about?"' said Mr. Vernon. 'I can only
remember the last part of it, though my little
daughter has often read it to me,' and he recited,
in a sweet, low voice, this exquisite
little fragment:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"What is the little one thinking about?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What does she think of her mother's eyes?</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What does she think of her mother's hair?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What, of the cradle roof that flies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Forward and backward through the air?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What does she think of her mother's breast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Round and beautiful, smooth and white,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Seeking it ever with fresh delight&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cup of her life, and couch of her rest?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What does she think, when her quick embrace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Presses her hand, and buries her face</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Deep, where the heart-throbs sink and swell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With a tender love she can never tell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Though she murmurs the words</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Of all the birds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Words she had learned to murmur well?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now she thinks she'll go to sleep!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I can see the shadow creep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Over her eyes in soft eclipse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Over her brow, and over her lips.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Out to her little finger-tips!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Softly sinking&mdash;down she goes!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down&mdash;she&mdash;goes!&mdash;down&mdash;she&mdash;goes!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">See! she is hushed in sweet repose."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"As the doctor gazed on this lovely scene,
and heard the beautifully touching words so
fitly spoken, instead of smiling, he frowned
and sighed, for his heart was troubled.</p>

<p>"Coming forward, he grumbled out, 'A
family party, I see.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the father, rising and smiling;
'and no one but yourself would find a
welcome.'</p>

<p>"'So much the better,' growled the doctor.
'Nurse, light the gas.'</p>

<p>"'We have not lit it yet,' said the young
mother, pointing to the two wax lights in a
distant corner, 'because they tell me the eyes
of infants are very weak and tender.'</p>

<p>"The doctor took no notice of this, only
nodded to the nurse; and she, standing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mortal fear that he would cut her head off
immediately if she hesitated, obeyed his
order.</p>

<p>"The mother looked at her little child,
who was still peacefully sleeping, and then
shaded her eyes with her hand from the sudden
blaze of light, thinking that though the
doctor seemed very cruel, he must be doing
what was right. Poor young mother!</p>

<p>"'I only need this last test before I tell
you what it means,' said the doctor. 'Here,
give me the child.'</p>

<p>"The father tenderly laid the little Eva
in his arms, though quite at a loss to imagine
what experiment was to be tried. The light
was certainly too strong to be let suddenly
into a darkened room, he thought; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
doctor knew best. It was strange that only
the noble-looking gentleman, Mr. Vernon,
seemed to divine the meaning of the rough
but kind-hearted man, but he knew only too
well; he was <i>sadly sure</i>. I will tell you why,
presently.</p>

<p>"And now the tender head of the sleeping
child lay helplessly against the physician's
rough coat, encircled by his arm.</p>

<p>"Suddenly he dashed some cold water,
that stood near, into her face.</p>

<p>"Little Eva awoke, and opened her dark
blue eyes immediately under the bright
stream of light. She did not cry; she did
not shrink; calmly she looked up, never
flinching, never winking as she lay.</p>

<p>"The doctor raised her nearer and nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to the flame; he turned the screws, and let
out each burner to its fullest capacity, and
passed his hands rapidly to and fro close to
the child's eyes, then turning towards the
wondering, panic-stricken group, who were
slowly beginning to understand the meaning
of that fearful pantomime, he laid her once
more in her father's arms, and looking in his
face, said, in a rough, broken voice, while a
great tear trembled in his eye&mdash;'God help
little Eva,&mdash;<span class="smcap">she is blind</span>.'</p>

<p>"The doctor went away that night with
the sorrowful wail of the poor parents smiting
his heart.</p>

<p>"He came again and again, but nevermore
in that house did he open the door
upon a group so smilingly happy, as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which greeted him on the fatal night, when
he told them the dreadful truth, that their
child would never see their faces, for she was
blind.</p>

<p>"And now I will tell you about Mr. Vernon.
When he was quite a young man, rich,
handsome, and surrounded with friends, he
was taken ill with a dreadful fever, which
left him totally blind. For a long, long time
he murmured at God's will, and refused to
believe there was any thing left worth living
for; but God's ways are not our ways, and in
His own good time He so softened the wilful
heart of the blind man, so that he became
not only resigned, but happy.</p>

<p>"After a few years, God gave him a
beautiful wife, who loved him more because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the affliction which made him so dependent
upon her loving care; and oh! how I
hope that all who are reading this true story
will have a tender pity for those upon whom
God has caused outward darkness to fall.
They cannot see the sunshine, or the beautiful
flowers&mdash;let them <i>feel</i> the warm sunshine
of a loving heart.</p>

<p>"In due course of time Mr. Vernon had
two lovely children, the elder a pretty little
maiden, with deep blue eyes, and dark, wavy
hair, whose sweet name was Ruth. The dear
little girl was six years old before the other
darling came to gladden his parents' heart,
and having no companions but her blind
father and gentle mother, she grew to be
quite a dignified little woman. None so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
proud and happy as Ruth, when she was
guiding her blind father; none knew better
all his favorite walks in and around the
beautiful country place where they lived;
and her gentle, patient ways made her the
very darling of his heart.</p>

<p>"In a few years there was another little
being in the world, to whose happiness Ruth
was necessary; and that was her poor blind
cousin, Eva, and though Ruth's parents
missed her sadly, they would often give up
their darling, and send or take her into the
city, to visit and comfort and amuse Eva.</p>

<p>"Ruth understood Eva better than any
one else, because she had been her dear blind
father's constant companion; and Eva loved
her with all her heart; she knew her step;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
she would hear it before any one else did,
and the color would rush in her face, and
she would wait with beating heart till the
door opened, and then she would rush to
her, throw her arms round her neck, and
cry, 'Oh, dear Ruth! darling Ruth!' and
kiss her twenty times, and Ruth would kiss
Eva just as many, and then they would sit
down close together, and have such a nice,
happy talk! for Ruth had to tell all about
the chickens, and Dandy, the pony, who
loved sugar so dearly; and how she had
hemmed six pocket-handkerchiefs for her
dear father, and most wore a hole in her
little thimble; and how her little baby
brother had scrabbled off with old Dobbin's
bran-bag, just as the poor old horse was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
going to eat his dinner, and poked his own
dear little head in it, and when he pulled it
out, the bran was all over his face, making
him look as if he was covered with freckles;
which funny caper made Eva laugh like 'any
thing.'</p>

<p>"And when the talking was over, Ruth
read to little Eva, for all toys were useless to
the blind child; but her books were doubly
dear, and Ruth was never tired of reading
to her; so while she staid, Eva was as happy
as it was possible to be.</p>

<p>"One day the good doctor brought a
celebrated occulist to see Eva. An occulist
is a physician who cures diseases of the
eyes, and devotes his whole time and talent
to that precious and delicate part of the human
frame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"The occulist examined her eyes very
carefully, and then said: 'After a few years
I can perform an operation on Eva's eyes
that <i>may</i> give her sight; but it will be a
very painful one, and perhaps I may not succeed.
If this dear little child were mine, I
would almost rather let her remain blind
than give her such terrible pain, which may
end in disappointment.'</p>

<p>"But oh! what a blessed hope! her parents
<i>would not</i> see the dark side; they dwelt
upon the happiness it would be for little
Eva to see; and one day her father took her
upon his knee, and, fondly kissing her, said:
'Eva, my darling, would you like to see the
beautiful sunlight and sweet flowers?'</p>

<p>"'O papa! yes! yes! but, most of all,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I want to see you and mamma, and Ruth
and Dinah.'</p>

<p>"'Well, my darling, if you can make up
your mind to endure a terrible pain, when
you are older we will have the operation
tried. It will only last a moment, dear Eva,
and then just think! you will see the whole
beautiful world! and know all of us by our
faces, as you now do by our steps and voices;
you will see the birds flying in the air; the
moon sailing slowly in the heavens, the
little twinkling stars, and the rippling water,
and we shall be so happy! so happy! I
will not tell you when to have it done; I
will wait till <i>you</i> are ready, my darling.'</p>

<span class="caption">EVA PRAYING FOR STRENGTH TO SAY THE WORDS.</span>
</div>

<p>"Then Eva thought long of it, and had
many an earnest conversation upon the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with her little cousin Ruth; and one
day she said: 'Ruth, will you promise me,
<i>true for true</i>, that you will come and hold
my hand when they operate upon my eyes?'</p>

<p>"'I promise you, <i>true for true</i>,' said
Ruth.</p>

<p>"And so the matter was settled.</p>

<p>"Time passed on; and Eva was now
eleven years old, and Ruth nine.</p>

<p>"Then Eva made a great resolution, and
going to her father, she said: '<i>Father, I am
ready</i> <span class="smcap">now</span>.'</p>

<p>"They were simple words; but poor little
Eva had prayed to God, for nights and
nights, and many times in the day, to give
her strength to say them, and God had heard
her prayer; for though her father turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
deadly pale at the words, the low sweet
voice of the child did not tremble.</p>

<p>"And now the good doctor came, all his
roughness gone, and he held that little head,
with its glossy waves of hair, to keep it
steady, but it trembled far less than he did;
for he had watched Eva from her infancy,
and dearly loved her, and he was intensely
interested in the result of the experiment
about to be performed.</p>

<p>"Near Eva stood her mother and her
brave and faithful cousin Ruth, holding her
hand, as she had promised '<i>true for true</i>,'
and telling her to take courage, for all would
be well.</p>

<p>"'Patience,' said the operator, softly; 'a
pang, and half the suffering will be over.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"The little hand which held Ruth's was
clasped more tightly, and a groan smote on
the listeners' ears. The room reeled&mdash;a faintness
came over the heroic child; but she
was soon herself again.</p>

<p>"'Would you not rather wait a day or
two for the other eye to be operated upon?'
said the kind physician. 'A week hence, or
a month, will answer.'</p>

<p>"'Oh! no,' answered Eva, with quiet self-possession,
'let it be done to-day; let it be
done <span class="smcap">now</span>. I do not think I could bear
the suspense, and it would <i>please my father</i>
to know that it was over.'</p>

<p>"Love sustained her. Another sigh&mdash;another
groan, and it was finished.</p>

<p>"Then came the bandages, the darkened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
room, the stillness, the repose, for one whose
nerves had been so shaken; but often those
little cousinly hands were clasped together
in a pressure which spoke more love than
many words.</p>

<p>"Her father hardly ever left the house,
and her mother wept often, for she loved her
child in her blindness as much as a mother
<i>could</i> love, and had never wished her to go
through so much suffering&mdash;suffering which
might be fruitless; and she waited for the
result with trembling anxiety.</p>

<p>"A <i>look</i> from a physician has often more
weight than many words spoken; and Ruth,
who read the good doctor's face with the
keenness of a child's perception, was the first
to see an expression of hope shining upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it. When the day came for the bandages
to be removed, Eva's father and mother
were so dreadfully agitated, that they had to
leave the room. Trembling, they stood outside
in the hall, waiting for the happy or
wretched tidings.</p>

<p>"But Ruth&mdash;brave little Ruth&mdash;held
Eva's hand as before. Those little clasped
hands gave each other courage, for Ruth
needed it as much as Eva, and her heartbeats
could almost be heard in the silence.
What a study her sweet little face was, as
the emotions of love, pity, fear, and hope,
crossed it, as shadowy clouds flit across the
sky!</p>

<p>"Slowly, cautiously, the bandages were
removed, and at last the end came, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
little girl saw upon the physician's face a
broad, cheerful, happy smile. Ruth was a
heroine, and had great self-control; but now
control became impossible. She thought not
of consequences&mdash;she only thought of the
unceasing prayer which had been breathed
by that household for many weeks&mdash;she
only saw that that prayer had been granted.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">She will see!</span> she will see!!' she almost
screamed. 'Eva! Eva! love! darling!
do you hear?'</p>

<p>"The physician gave her a stern look of
rebuke, but it was too late; Little Eva had
fainted.</p>

<p>"'<i>Ruth is right</i>,' said he to the father
and mother, who had rushed in at this
blessed announcement, 'but she has been too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
abrupt. Her cousin and herself are wonderful
little women in times of trial and danger;
but neither of them are equal to a sudden
joy.'</p>

<p>"It was a long time before Eva got well,
and was permitted to use her new and
precious gift of sight; but then the amazement
and delight with which she ran from
one thing to another&mdash;the joy with which
she gazed upon the faces of her parents and
Ruth, no one of us, who have always seen,
can ever know or appreciate.</p>

<p>"And old Binah said, as she hugged her
darling to her faithful breast, 'God bress
de good massa dat gib de sight to my little
missis. It don't make no sort of difference
to she, case old Binah <i>black</i>. Dear, no! she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
lub her just de same when she see <i>dat!</i> don't
you, little missis?'</p>

<p>"'Why, <i>of course</i> I do,' answered little
Eva, and she kissed good old Binah, and ran
off with Ruth to look at some flowers. Oh,
that precious sight! how dear it was, to
her!</p>

<p>"And now she is no longer <i>poor</i> rich little
Eva."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The children had listened to the story
of Eva, with eager, breathless attention; and
when Ruth screamed out, "She will see! she
will see!" they very nearly screamed, too,
so rejoiced were they that the blindness had
been removed; and the dear little girl had
not suffered so much for nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be so terrible to be blind,"
said Anna; "don't you remember when we
went to see the exhibition of the blind children
at the Academy of Music, the tears
were rolling down mamma's face nearly the
whole time, and we all felt so sorry, that we
came home quite unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Dear me," cried Harry, "I do wish
there was no such affliction; why must there
be, mamma?"</p>

<p>"God knows best, dear Harry," answered
the little mother. "If He did not, for
His own wise purpose, permit us to know
trouble and sorrow in this world, we would
never desire that blessed rest and peace hereafter,
which he promises to all those who
put their trust in him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, God must know best," said Clara,
in a low voice; "for dear Charley has had
more suffering and sorrow than any of us,
and yet he loves Him, and wants to go to
heaven."</p>

<p>"When Charley was very little," said the
mother, "I found him crying bitterly one
day. 'Why, what is the matter, my darling?'
I said.</p>

<p>"'Oh mamma!' he sobbed, 'I am so
afraid there won't be room enough in heaven
for me! Do you think such a poor, lame
child can get there?'</p>

<p>"I took him in my arms, and kissed and
comforted him, and told him that Jesus looked
at the heart, not at the weak, crooked
body; and that the better and purer his life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was, the greater would be his welcome to
His house Beautiful, when life had ended
here."</p>

<p>All the children looked at Charley, with
their eyes full of love; and in their prayers
that night, they entreated that Jesus would
remember their dear little brother's life-long
suffering, and give him a place close to Him
in heaven.</p>

<h2>THE FOURTH LETTER.</h2>

<h3>ILL TEMPER.</h3>

<div class='center'><i>For George.</i></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear George</span>:&mdash;You know you are
now nearly seventeen years old, and quite a
patriarch in the Nightcap family; and I am
rejoiced that I can say with truth, that you
have been, and are, a most excellent elder
brother, unselfish, sweet-tempered, and always
setting a good example."</p>

<p>"Dear me," interrupted George, laughing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and blushing very much, "I do not deserve
such high praise;" but here the expression
of his face changed, his lip began to tremble,
and running up to his mother, he kissed her,
and said&mdash;"Whatever I am that is good,
you, dear mother, have made me."</p>

<p>"With God's help and blessing, my dear
son," said his mother, returning the kiss; and
then she went on reading.</p>

<p>"When you were a little fellow, of not
quite seven years, you had the scarlet fever,
and were very ill; and perhaps you remember
how cross you were for a long time after."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," exclaimed George; "mother
used to say somebody else must have jumped
into my skin, for, certainly, I was not the same
George."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have written a story about this change
in temper, and how a cure was effected. <i>You</i>
became sweet-tempered again, as soon as you
got quite well; but Arthur, in my story, required
a lesson and some punishment, as he
became cross without scarlet fever, rhyme,
or reason. I hope you will let me know if
you think I have invented a good plan to
cure a cross-patch. You know I am a great
believer in our always trying first upon <i>ourselves</i>,
what we propose to '<i>do to others</i>,' as
the very best way of finding out if we would
like the same '<i>done to us</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the 'golden rule!'" cried
little Minnie; and now the children settled
themselves, and eagerly listened to the following
story:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />ILL TEMPER.</div>

<p>"When Arthur was about seven years
old, he was one of the very best boys to be
found in a long summer's day. In the morning
he would spring out of bed with a bright
smile, wash and dress himself quickly, with
the help of Mary, his kind nurse, say his
prayers slowly and reverently, (ah! <i>that</i> was
the secret of his goodness!) and then all day
long he would be so obliging and good-tempered,
that no one could help loving him that
knew him; and so they didn't try to help it,
for everybody loved him dearly.</p>

<p>"But, alas! I have heard the doctors say,
(and of course <i>they</i> must know,) that once in
every seven years the whole body is renewed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
flesh, bones, blood, nerves, muscles; and I
grieve to have to relate, that in Arthur's
case the change seemed to include his spirit-part
also; that is, his good temper and loving
ways marched out of him, and some very
bad substitutes marched in, as I shall proceed
to relate.</p>

<p>"One morning Arthur awoke at his usual
hour, but not with his usual smile. His face
was all puckered up like a frozen apple. He
floundered about the bed, and bumped his
head against the head-board, and was just as
cross as forty bears.</p>

<p>"Of course every thing went wrong; he
put his stockings on wrongside out, tied his
shoes in a hard knot, pulled on his pantaloons
with the back part before, and drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his arms through his jacket upside down.
Did you ever hear of such a piece of
work?</p>

<p>"When Mary came to brush his hair and
wash his face, he screamed out, stamping his
foot at her&mdash;'Do stop! Stop! I tell you!
You brush me as hard as ever you can! I
wish you would leave me alone, you ugly old
thing!'</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear, what a sad boy! He
puts me in mind of that other naughty boy
who scolded his nurse in a piece of poetry.
This is it:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Oh <i>why</i> must my face be washed so clean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And scrubbed and scoured for Sunday?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When you know very well, as you've always seen,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Twill be dirty again on Monday.</span><br />
<br />
"'My hair is stiff with the hateful soap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That behind my ears is dripping;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My smarting eyes, I'm afraid to ope,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And my lips the suds are sipping.</span><br />
<br />
"'They're down my throat, and they're up my nose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to choke me you seem to be trying,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That I'll shut my mouth, you needn't suppose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For how can I keep from crying?</span><br />
<br />
"'And you rub as hard as ever you can,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And your hands are hard, to my sorrow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No woman shall wash me, when I'm a man,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I wish I was one to-morrow.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"But at last Arthur went sulking down
to breakfast, <i>forgetting to say his prayers;</i>
and taking his seat at the table, whined out,
the very first thing&mdash;'Just look at this piece
of toast; it is all burnt, and as hard as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
stone. I won't have it!' Then he tasted
his coffee, and exclaimed&mdash;'Pooh! what coffee!
perfect slops!'</p>

<p>"His mother was grieved to see him acting
so naughtily, and said, gently&mdash;'I am
sorry, Arthur, you are not pleased; will you
have an egg?'</p>

<p>"Arthur cracked an egg with his teaspoon,
looked at it, threw it down, and turning
up his nose with disdain, said&mdash;'Eggs!
Brickbats you mean! they have been boiling
all night.'</p>

<p>"This exhibition of ill temper distressed
his mother exceedingly, but she did not say
any thing to him then; being a woman of
excellent sense, she formed a plan in her mind
which she hoped would effect a cure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arthur was an only child. His parents
were rich, and they preferred that he should
be educated at home; they feared his learning
evil as well as good at a large school.
Hitherto this plan had been very successful,
for Arthur was as studious and obedient as
his tutors could possibly wish; and this sudden
and sad change made all around him
unhappy. I will give you a history of one
of these miserable days.</p>

<p>"On this morning, his tutor arrived, as
usual, at nine o'clock; and commenced by
giving his pupil a lesson in penmanship.
There was an ominous scowl on Arthur's
face. He twitched his copy-book before him,
pretended he could not find a good pen,
scratched and blotted the paper from top to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bottom, and so, when the lesson was finished,
the page was a sight to behold.</p>

<p>"'You have not tried to write well,' said
his master, mildly.</p>

<p>"'My pen was abominable, and the paper
was greasy,' said Arthur, sulkily.</p>

<p>"'A bad workman always pretends that
his <i>tools</i> are to blame,' said the master.</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear me! you are never satisfied!
If I write too lightly, you say it looks as if a
spider had scampered over the paper with
inky legs; if I bear on harder, you ask me
how much horse power I have put on to
make such heavy strokes. I don't know
what to do! I don't! You are always grumbling.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, no! not always, for here are a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
many pages on which I have written, "Very
well; very well, indeed."'</p>

<p>"'That was only by chance,' said Arthur.</p>

<p>"'But if these chances do not always occur,
whose fault is it?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, mine! I suppose you mean to say,'
answered Arthur, pettishly.</p>

<p>"'Well, my dear boy, only look at your
writing to-day. It resembles a company of
soldiers, each of whom carries his musket to
suit himself, this one to the right, that to the
left, a third horizontally, a fourth perpendicularly,
and all the rest of the letters with
broken backs and crooked legs. Just look
at it!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear! you are always mocking me,'
whined Arthur. 'One would think I did it
all on purpose. Oh, dear me!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last this lesson came to an end; but
the others were no better, and the poor master
went away with his temper sorely tried,
sadly remembering the happy and good little
Arthur of the year before.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon, his mother said, in a
pleasant tone, 'Come, dear Arthur, come
and take a walk with me; it is such a lovely
day; the robins are singing in the trees; and
look, how fast the delicate white clouds are
sailing through the air! Come, dear.'</p>

<p>"'It isn't pleasant! and I can't <i>bear</i>
robins,' said Arthur.</p>

<p>"His mother sighed and went alone.</p>

<p>"Left at home, Arthur tried to amuse
himself. He got out his puzzle, or dissected
map of the United States; but as ill-tempered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
people are never patient or gentle, in a
very little while he had cracked South Carolina
nearly in two, snapped off the top of
Maryland, broken New York into three
pieces, and made mince-meat of the Union
generally, which was a very shocking thing
to do, even on a dissected map; and then,
the cross boy ended by throwing all the
States into the black coal-scuttle.</p>

<p>"After this he tried to read; but nothing
seemed to amuse him. From 'Robinson
Crusoe' he went to the 'Rollo Books,' and
from those to 'Nightcaps,' and declared they
were all stupid alike, 'a perfect pack of nonsense!'</p>

<p>"As a last resource, he called Jumbo, his
big cat, who was so fond of Arthur, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
would let him do just what he pleased with
him, that is, as long as his little master was
kind; but to-day he pinched his ears, and
pulled his tail, and twitched his whiskers at
such a rate, that poor Jumbo puckered up
his face like a pudding-bag, and squalled like
a first-class opera singer.</p>

<p>"'The bad old thing!' exclaimed Arthur.
'I declare, he ought to be drowned! I'll
never play with him again. Scat! scat! get
out!' and off scampered poor Jumbo, and hid
himself behind the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"All this time you are wondering his
mother did not punish him. Wait a little.
Just read to the end, and then tell me what
you think of her mode of punishment. I shall
wish very much to know if you approve of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"One evening, after Arthur had gone to
bed, his father and mother had a long consultation
with each other about the best way
of curing Arthur's ill temper; and they
agreed upon a plan his mother had thought
of during the day.</p>

<p>"The next morning came, when the trial
was to be made. Every one received his or
her instructions from Arthur's mother, and
were quite ready to begin the new mode of
punishment.</p>

<p>"But, for a wonder, on this particular
morning Arthur awoke feeling very pleasant
and amiable. Never mind, he was to receive
his lesson all the same.</p>

<p>"While Mary was helping him to dress,
she seemed very snappish and impatient.</p>

<span class="caption">ARTHUR&#39;S MOTHER TELLING HER PLAN.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Do, for goodness sake, keep still, Master
Arthur!' she said; 'you are always fidgeting
and fussing.'</p>

<p>"'<i>I?</i>' said Arthur, laughing. 'Why, I've
been as still as a mouse!'</p>

<p>"Mary was silent for a moment, but presently
she exclaimed&mdash;'How carelessly you
have washed your hands, your shirt is all
wet. I have shown you how to wash without
splashing a hundred times. You worry my
life out!'</p>

<p>"'I <i>tried</i> to do as you told me,' said
Arthur, with a little sigh.</p>

<p>"'Oh, fiddlesticks! don't tell <i>me!</i> You
are a terrible boy!' and Mary bounced out
of the room, banging the door behind her.</p>

<p>"Arthur went down to breakfast, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ran up to his mother to tell her about Mary.
'I think <i>she</i> was "terrible,"' he said. 'What
could be the matter with her, mamma?'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps she was indulging in <span class="smcap">ill temper</span>,'
answered his mother, significantly.</p>

<p>"When they sat down to breakfast there
was no toast.</p>

<p>"'I should like a piece of toast,' said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"His mother rang a little bell, and the
cook came in. She looked first at the mistress,
with a peculiar smile, and then she
looked at Arthur.</p>

<p>"'Margaret,' said he, 'there is no toast.'</p>

<p>"'I know it, Master Arthur; it was too
brown; and you are so hard to suit, that I
did not dare to serve it.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"'<i>I</i> hard to suit?' cried Arthur, who
seemed to have forgotten what a naughty
boy he had been. '<i>I</i> hard to suit? Not at
all. If the toast <i>is</i> a little too brown, I don't
mind it. Give it to me, Margaret.'</p>

<p>"'I threw it away,' said the cook.</p>

<p>"'Oh, well, I'm in no hurry; I will wait
while you make me another piece.'</p>

<p>"'My fire has gone out,' said the cook.</p>

<p>"'Well, you can re-light it, can't you?'</p>

<p>"'Do you think I have nothing to do
but to wait upon you?' cried the cook. 'You
know nothing ever suits you; and you always
speak rudely to me;' and she flounced
out of the room.</p>

<p>"'How <i>can</i> she say so, mamma?' cried
Arthur. '<i>I</i> speak rudely to her? Why, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was as polite as ever I could be. It is too
bad!'</p>

<p>"'Servants find it very hard to attend
upon you, Arthur. They are accustomed to
polite treatment from the rest of us.'</p>

<p>"'Well&mdash;but mamma&mdash;to accuse me to-day,
when it was <i>she</i> who'&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Was indulging in <span class="smcap">ill-temper</span>,' interrupted
his mother.</p>

<p>"<i>Arthur understood</i>, and was silent.</p>

<p>"The hour for his grammar lesson had
now arrived. The tutor bowed to Arthur's
mother, smiled, and commenced:</p>

<p>"'Do you <i>know</i> your lessons, my young
friend?'</p>

<p>"'I have studied them, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Do you <i>know</i> them? It is of little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
consequence that you have studied them, if
you do not know them.'</p>

<p>"'I believe I do, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Well, let us see&mdash;begin.'</p>

<p>"'In the <i>tenses</i>,' began Arthur a little
embarrassed, 'we should distinguish the
<i>moods</i> and the verbs.'</p>

<p>"'Nonsense! you should have said, "In
the <i>verbs</i> we should distinguish the moods
and the tenses."'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir, that is what I <i>meant</i> to say;
I knew that, but my tongue slipped.'</p>

<p>"'Your tongue slips very often. Continue'&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arthur, still more <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'embarrased'">embarrassed</ins>, said&mdash;'We
should also distinguish the <i>moods</i> and
the persons.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You must be demented! What have
the moods to do in that sentence? Perhaps
you are expecting a visit from the man in
the moon, and that makes you talk such
nonsense. The grammar says&mdash;"We should
distinguish the <i>numbers</i> and the persons."
Your tongue does nothing but slip; you
do not know your lesson.'</p>

<p>"'Excuse me, sir; I do know it.'</p>

<p>"'You are not respectful, Master Arthur,'
said the teacher in a cold, severe tone.</p>

<p>"'But, sir'&mdash;</p>

<p>"'When a boy knows his lesson he does
not make such abominable blunders in reciting.'</p>

<p>"'But, sir, you troubled me; you put
me out.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"'<i>I</i> trouble you? A very singular excuse,
and a very poor one. Come, let me
look at your composition.'</p>

<p>"But here matters became worse and
worse. The master 'pshawed,' and frowned,
and grumbled to himself. 'No application!
no thought! bad spelling! bad grammar! a
perfect mass of faults!'</p>

<p>"Arthur grew red and pale by turns, as
his teacher wrote right across the page in
large letters: 'A composition so badly done,
that it is impossible to correct it.'</p>

<p>"Then he rose coldly, looking very grim,
took his hat, and addressing Arthur's mother,
said&mdash;'Madam, I cannot consent to teach
your son any longer; I have so little success,
that I feel I have no right to the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
liberal salary you have accorded me. Another,
perhaps, will do better.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, sir! no! pray, don't go!' exclaimed
Arthur; 'I will try to do better! indeed,
I will! upon my word and honor I will. I
love you, sir!'</p>

<p>"A pleasant light suddenly came into
the teacher's eyes, and a soft smile passed
like lightning over his lips.</p>

<p>"'Do, please, give me your hand, sir,'
said Arthur, 'and promise me that you will
continue to teach me.'</p>

<p>"His broad, black eyebrows immediately
contracted into a great frown; and he
said gruffly&mdash;'Very well, I will try you once
more,' and left the room.</p>

<p>"For a few moments there was silence;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
then a distressed expression came over Arthur's
face, as he said&mdash;'Mamma, my teacher
was very&mdash;(he was at a loss for a word)
very <i>singular</i> with me to-day&mdash;don't you
think so, mamma?'</p>

<p>"'What do you mean by <i>singular?</i>'</p>

<p>"'Why, not as he usually is&mdash;not at
all.'</p>

<p>"'His reproofs seemed perfectly just to
me; you were not perfect in your lessons.'</p>

<p>"'Well, mamma, I do not deny that; but
at all other times he has been so kind and patient,
and never treated me with such unexpected
severity.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' said his mother, 'I am afraid,
then, that this morning he was indulging in
<span class="smcap">ill temper</span>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arthur hung his head, and was silent:
his conscience was busy whispering to him,
and the rest of the morning passed painfully;
but after luncheon, he prepared for a walk
with joy, for the day was lovely, and the air
exhilarating.</p>

<p>"But all at once the sky became overcast,
and very soon after the rain fell in torrents.</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear me, how tiresome!' cried
Arthur, 'just when I am going to take a
walk; it is perfectly hateful.'</p>

<p>"'God sends the rain,' said his mother,
gently.</p>

<p>"Arthur hung his head again without
answering. What could he say, indeed?
But with his new resolution strong in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
mind, he determined to bear this disappointment
with patience; and he called Jumbo to
play with him.</p>

<p>"But the cat, usually so quick to come
purring to his knee, remained just where he
was, as if he had been suddenly struck deaf,
and dumb, and blind. Arthur went to him,
and tried to take him in his arms; but he
hissed at his playmate, and scampered away
with his back and tail high in the air, and
hid under the sofa.</p>

<p>"'Ah me!' sighed Arthur, 'I suppose
Jumbo is like the rest; he is indulging in
<span class="smcap">ill temper</span>, too.'</p>

<p>"'Not quite that,' observed his mother;
'but animals have <i>memories</i>.'</p>

<p>"'I think you had better say that they
are spiteful, mamma.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Perhaps they are, my son; but they
have no reason, while <i>we</i> are capable of controlling
our impatience, and governing our
passions, if we ask God to help us.'</p>

<p>"Upon this Arthur fairly broke down;
and, bursting into tears, sobbed out&mdash;'Oh,
dear mamma, I understand the lesson I have
received from every one to-day. Do believe
that I will try with all my strength to
conquer my ill temper: I promise you. Do,
please mamma, forgive me.'</p>

<p>"His mother wound her loving arms
around her son, and tenderly kissed him, and
said&mdash;'I forgive you, my dear child, with all
my heart, and we will both pray to our Heavenly
Father to send down His Holy Spirit to
guide and direct your efforts to do right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
You have borne your disappointments to-day
with patience and resignation; and I
feel that you will soon be the good, sweet-tempered
boy, you were a year ago.'</p>

<p>"Arthur kept his promise, and whenever
he was tempted to give a cross answer, or
get in a passion, he was sure to remember
in time the celebrated day when everybody,
by his mother's instructions, attempted his
cure, by showing him, in their own persons,
the unlovely consequences of indulging in</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">ill temper</span>."<br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"What a nice story!" exclaimed the
children, "and what a good way of curing
Arthur&mdash;better than a hundred whippings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
When we do any thing bad, mamma, you
must punish us Aunt Fanny's way. Couldn't
you punish us for something now?"</p>

<p>The little mother laughed at this comical
request, and said&mdash;"I can't think of any
thing just now to punish you for; and I
hope you don't want to do any thing
naughty on purpose."</p>

<p>"O dear, no!" cried the children, but
George, with a good-humored twinkle in his
eye, added&mdash;"At any rate, mamma, the next
time Harry puts salt into the sugar-bowl,
and makes me spoil my coffee, I intend to
put powdered sugar into the salt-cellar for
him to sprinkle over his stewed oysters."</p>

<p>"Oh, do!" cried all the children; "only
think of oysters and sugar! perfectly dreadful!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well,' said Harry, laughing, 'I shall
have to buy a snuff-box, then, and keep it in
my pocket full of salt.'</p>

<p>"'But don't forget yourself,' said Anna,
'and politely offer a pinch of it to the first
old lady you meet; she might think you
meant to play a trick upon her, you know.'</p>

<p>"'What an idea!' cried Harry; 'I
wouldn't do such a thing; I should think it
would make her sneeze worse than any snuff.
Wouldn't it?'</p>

<p>"'The best way to find that out,' said
George, with a roguish smile, 'would be to
take a good pinch yourself.'</p>

<p>"While this conversation had been going
on, little Johnny had disappeared in the
pantry; and now, at this very moment, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
came out, screaming: 'Oh! my nose hurts!
my nose hurts!' and ran to his mother.</p>

<p>"It seems that, anxious to find out what
kind of snuff salt would make, he had privately
walked into the pantry, and had
snuffed and poked quite a quantity into his
poor little nose, and now it smarted as if
twenty hornets had stung him at once; and
he jumped up and down with the pain.</p>

<p>"They had a great time soaking his
nose in warm water, and felt very sorry for
him, though they could not, for their lives,
help laughing when George said that Johnny
had salted and pickled his nose so well, that
it would keep in the hottest weather; at
any rate, it would last him as long as he
lived; which comforted Johnny very much,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
for he thought that it might have to be cut
off to get the salt out.</p>

<p>"After this they bid everybody good
night, and went to bed, and Johnny said he
felt 'pretty <i>compertuffle</i>.' His mother had
told him that 'good little Henry,' of whom
you have read, always said 'compertuffle' for
'comfortable,' and Johnny thought it was
just the right word to express his feelings."</p>

<h2>THE FIFTH LETTER.</h2>

<h3>THE ROSE CROWN.</h3>

<div class='center'><i>For Clara.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear, tender-hearted little Clara</span>:&mdash;In
the olden time, there was a beautiful
superstition in Germany, that on Christmas
eve our Saviour, just as he was when a little
child here below, comes at midnight in at
the door, and fills all those children's shoes
with gifts, who have followed His example
of goodness and obedience. You know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<i>you</i> hang up your <i>stockings</i>, and Santa Claus
comes down the chimney; but the little
German children believe that they are far
more blessed. It is a beautiful idea, for it
brings Him, who for our sakes became a little
child on earth, more closely and lovingly to
the children's hearts. They grow up sure of
His love and sympathy, from infancy to old
age.</p>

<p>I have asked Sarah ("the doctor") to
write me another story after the German
fashion, on purpose for you. She has given
me this "Rose Crown;" and the story turns
upon the sweet and solemn belief of the German
children.</p>

<p>You will perceive that the little Gottfried
in the story thought of this with such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
intensity, and with such perfect faith in its
truth, as to cause him to walk in his sleep,
like a somnambulist. No doubt your dear
mother can tell you many strange and extraordinary
stories of somnambulists, who do
the most wonderful and startling things
while in this kind of trance state, of which
they are utterly unconscious when they
awake.</p>

<p>I hope this story will please my dear
little Clara; it is called</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE ROSE CROWN.</div>

<p>"It was Christmas eve, and a cold winter's
day. The flakes of snow fell softly and
thickly, and had already covered the earth
with a white cloak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"At one of the windows of the large
house that stands on the top of the hill,
where the purple violets first peep out in the
spring-time, stood the little Gottfried and his
sister Marie.</p>

<p>"'Only look, dear Marie,' said Gottfried,
'how fast the snow falls! What large flakes!
They look like little milk-white doves.'</p>

<p>"'It is the Mother Holle shaking her
feather-beds,' cried Marie, laughing; and
looking up towards the sky, and beckoning
with her hand, she sang&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Mother Holle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Good wife Holle,</span><br />
Fill the meadows fair and full:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Stay not, pause not,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shake away,</span><br />
Make the snow fall fast to-day.'<br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh! I can sing a prettier song than
thine,' said Gottfried. 'Listen, now. The
good wife Katarine taught it to me;' and he
sang&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'See the snow-flakes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Merry snow-flakes!</span><br />
How they fall from yonder sky,<br />
Coming lightly, coming sprightly,<br />
Dancing downwards, from on high.<br />
Faint or tire, will they never,<br />
Wheeling round and round forever.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Surely nothing do I know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Half so merry as the snow;</span><br />
Half so merry, merry, merry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As the dancing, glancing snow.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'See the snow-flakes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Solemn snow-flakes!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>How they whiten, melt and die.<br />
In what cold and shroud-like masses<br />
O'er the buried earth they lie.<br />
Lie as though the frozen plain<br />
Ne'er would bloom with flowers again.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Surely nothing do I know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Half so solemn as the snow,</span><br />
Half so solemn, solemn, solemn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the falling, melting snow.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"'Ah! thy song is sad, brother,' said
little Marie: 'it makes me sigh.'</p>

<p>"As she spoke, a little boy, poorly clad,
was seen coming up the avenue; and Gottfried
exclaimed&mdash;'Here comes Heinrich!'
and running out of the room, he presently
returned, leading by the hand Heinrich, the
little faggot-maker, whose mother, a poor
but pious widow, lived in a hut just out of
the village.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Why, Heinrich, where hast thou been
this cold day?' asked Marie.</p>

<p>"'Taking my faggots to Herr Kaufferman's,'
said the poor boy. 'But oh, Gottfried,
they have there the most beautiful
Christmas Tree!' and then Heinrich paused
and sighed.</p>

<p>"'And to-night the dear <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Christ-kindcherr'">Christkindchen</ins>,
or Holy Child, will bring them presents,'
said Gottfried. 'I hope he will fill
<i>thy</i> shoes full.'<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 301px;">

<span class="caption">THE BAD BOY TAUNTING HEINRICH.</span>
</div>

<p>"'Alas! the Christ-child never comes to
me,' said Heinrich.</p>

<p>"'What! hast thou never heard how he
comes at midnight, bearing a lighted taper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and a crown of white roses, and gives presents
to all the good children?'</p>


<p>"'My mother has told me of this,' said
Heinrich, 'and I have waited and watched,
but he <i>never</i> comes! He never <i>will</i> come.
It was only yesterday that I met Hans, the
butcher's son, and he mocked me, and snapped
his fingers in my face, and said&mdash;"Thou
art so poor, that thy shoes will never have
any thing in them;" and I was so angry, and
wanted to strike him, but my mother said I
must never fight or quarrel with any one,
and I went away from him; but it is hard
to be poor,' and here he began to cry.</p>

<p>"'Ah! yes, it is sad, dear Heinrich; but
do not weep; here, wipe thine eyes with my
new pocket-handkerchief. Come, now, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
happy; and I will pray to the Christ-child,
and beg him to come this very night to
thee.'</p>

<p>"At this the little faggot-maker's face
brightened, and soon after he went away.</p>

<p>"In the evening, the children had their
supper, and soon after they stood by the
knee of their kind mother, and sang this
hymn:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Jesus, our Shepherd! we ask for thy blessing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Through the long hours of this dreary night;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let us not know (thy kind favor possessing)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Danger or sorrow, till morning is bright.</span><br />
<br />
"Jesus, our Saviour! oh! grant thy protection,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To thy dear arms we have trustingly come;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, Lamb of God! make secure our election,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Guard us, and keep us, and call us thine own.</span><br />
<br />
"Jesus, our Crown! Oh, thou Heavenly Glory!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Humbly we kneel, and entreat thee to love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bless and receive us, as in Bible story,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till we shall come to thy mansion above."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"When they had finished the hymn, they
reverently repeated their prayers; and then,
each bidding the other good night and sweet
dreams, went to their white-curtained beds.</p>

<p>"Later at night, their mother came to
see that they were warm. Gottfried was
still awake; he was troubled about little
Heinrich; and he told his mother how the
poor boy had grieved because the Christ-child
never came to him. 'I have prayed
to Him, dear mother; do you think He will
hear me?' said the tender-hearted boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes, dear child,' said the mother, 'dost
thou not remember what the hymn says?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'And when, dear Jesus, I kneel down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Morning and night to prayer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Something there is within my heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which tells me <span class="smcap">thou art there</span>."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"'He works sometimes through <i>human</i>
hands; and now look thou, my little Gottfried,'
continued his mother, kissing him, 'I
will make this night a wreath of white roses
for thee, and fasten a purse about the stems,
with some golden guilders within, and thou
shalt take it to Heinrich to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, thou dearest mother!' cried Gottfried,
joyfully, and the loving kisses were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pressed upon her cheek. 'The dear Jesus
has heard me already;' and kneeling in the
bed, he poured out his grateful thanks; and
then lying down, he soon fell asleep, with a
bright flush of happiness upon his face.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"The snow had ceased to fall, and it was
late, but still in the widow's cottage the fitful
fire-light (for candles there were none)
showed her bending over some work. By
her side on the hearth crouched the little
Heinrich.</p>

<p>"'Go to bed, dear child,' said his mother;
'it is too late for thee.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, dear mother! let me wait for
thee,' answered the boy; 'it is so cold and
dark in our little room above.' He was silent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for a moment, gazing into the fire in a wishful
manner; then he said&mdash;'Mother, dost
thou think the Christ-child will indeed hear
Gottfried's prayer, and come to me and
thee?'</p>

<p>"'I hope he will, my Heinrich,' said the
sad mother, smiling faintly.</p>

<p>"'Ah, but mother, dost thou not <i>know</i> it?'</p>

<p>"The fire burned low, and the poor
woman could no longer see. She put up the
coarse sewing with a sigh, and resting her
hand tenderly on her boy's head, sat quite
still.</p>

<p>"Not a sound was heard. The light in
the room was dim, and gloom had settled
upon the hearts of both mother and child.</p>

<p>"Hark! what was that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"A low tap sounded at the door, and
then it slowly opened; and to the astonished
gaze of the two sitting by the hearth, there
appeared the figure of a little child. A
snow-white robe draped his slender limbs.
In one hand he bore a lighted taper, and in
the other a most beautiful wreath of white
roses. His dark blue eyes shone with an unearthly
lustre, as it appeared to the amazed
and bewildered Heinrich, and his golden
curls floated upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Oh! mother! mother!' whispered Heinrich,
almost breathless, 'it is the Christ-child
in very truth come to me at last. His face
is like Gottfried's&mdash;only far more beautiful;'
and mother and son sank on their knees.</p>

<p>"Slowly the little form advanced towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
them, paused before Heinrich, lightly
placed the rose crown upon his head, and
then, the sweet lips parting in a faint, tender
smile, it waved its little hand towards him,
and disappeared from their sight.</p>

<p>"When they could speak, the mother
and son bowed their heads in thankful prayer,
then lifted their brimming eyes to each
other.</p>

<p>"'Truly thou hast been wondrously rewarded,
my Heinrich,' said the poor widow;
'give the beautiful crown to me, that I may
see what the dear Christ-child has brought
to thee.'</p>

<p>"She stirred the fire, and put on some
light wood to make a blaze, and then Heinrich
lifted the crown from his head. As he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
did so&mdash;oh! wonder! there fell from it a
silken purse, and through the deep crimson
network they could see the yellow gleam of
gold.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"With the early blush of morning little
Gottfried awoke, and the first thing he did
was to run smilingly to the door to find his
shoes. There they were, in good truth,
crammed to the very top with presents.
Marie, too, awoke at the moment, and from
each little white bed there arose delighted
exclamations and merry shouts of joy.</p>

<p>"Now their mother entered, and said&mdash;'A
merry Christmas to you, my children.'</p>

<p>"With joyful kisses they welcomed her,
and breathlessly showed her their gifts;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
then Gottfried exclaimed&mdash;'Oh! mother! I
have had such a pleasant dream; I dreamed
that the dear Christ-child went to Heinrich
with the wreath, and gave it to him.'</p>

<p>"'Well, thou shalt take it thyself this
morning, dear child, when thou hast eaten
thy breakfast.'</p>

<p>"But what was this? Where could the
wreath be? The good mother, faithful to
her promise had made it the evening before,
and had laid it on the table in the parlor,
but it was not to be found.</p>

<p>"This loss put the little Gottfried in
such distress, that his mother promised quickly
to make another; and she was just preparing
to hasten out to purchase the roses,
when Heinrich ran in, his mother following;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and, scarcely pausing for breath, the boy
told the wonderful thing that had happened
to them in the night.</p>

<p>"With a sudden understanding of the
strange and beautiful story, Gottfried's
mother took Heinrich's mother aside, and
whispered to her how the rose crown had
mysteriously disappeared from the house in
the night.</p>

<p>"The two mothers gazed into each other's
faces, and then looked with love and wonder
at the little unconscious Gottfried. Tender
tears and smiles struggled in their faces,
for they knew in a moment that it was he
who had risen in his sleep, had taken the
rose crown to Heinrich, and had laid his
head upon his pillow again without waking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"When they gently and tenderly told
the strange tale to the wondering children,
Heinrich, bursting into tears, threw his arms
passionately round Gottfried's neck, and
sobbed out&mdash;'Oh! Gottfried! how thou must
have loved me to have done this thing, even
while sleeping;' and the grateful boy never
forgot it. He kept his crown of roses as
his dearest treasure, though they soon became
withered and brown; and Gottfried
and Heinrich were always friends, though
one was rich and the other poor; and
each mother loved and blessed the child of
the other even as her own."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[NOTE.&mdash;This story was suggested by reading about Christmas
in Germany, in Bayard Taylor's "Views Afoot."]</p></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"A&mdash;h!" sighed the children, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
story was finished; "this is the best of all!
How those two German boys must have
loved each other ever after."</p>

<p>"Gottfried must have been almost as
good as Charley," said Clara, with a glance full
of love towards her brother. The little girl,
with her sweet, sensitive nature, and gentle,
caressing ways, seemed closer to Charley than
the rest, though he loved all his brothers
and sisters with his whole heart; but Clara
was softer and tenderer, and murmured out
her love in such a dove-like way, that, next
to his mother, the sick boy liked to have her
smooth his hair, and hold his hand, and
kneel by his side in prayer; and the rest of
the children knew this, and lovingly gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Clara "her place." Not a shade of envy,
that black and wicked passion, ever entered
their hearts; for, as I have many times written,
this was the home of <span class="smcap">Love</span>.</p>

<h2>THE SIXTH LETTER.</h2>

<h3>THE HUNT FOR A STEAMBOAT.</h3>

<div class='center'><i>To Johnny.</i></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear little Johnny</span>:&mdash;I have heard such
a cunning little story about two little children
that live in New York, that I have written
it out for you; I shall begin it, "Once
upon a time"&mdash;the way you like best. Here
it is:</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE HUNT FOR A STEAMBOAT.</div>

<p>"Once upon a time little Harry was playing
in the parlor, and his kind mother was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
reading. Presently the door opened, and a
lady entered, holding by the hand the dearest
little bit of a girl you ever saw, about
three years old, with such sweet blue eyes
and soft curling hair, that she looked almost
like a fairy.</p>

<p>"Harry's mother was very glad to see
the lady; she kissed her and little Nannie,
and made them sit on the very best sofa, and
Harry kissed Nannie, and everybody seemed
very much pleased.</p>

<p>"After saying what a very fine day it was,
just as all the grown people do when they
begin to talk, Nannie's mamma began to tell
Harry's mamma something very wonderful,
when, all at once, they saw Harry's eyes
opened about as big round as a pair of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
saucers, and a dozen ears seemed to have
sprouted out all over his head; and he was
listening to the wonderful story with every
one of them.</p>

<p>"Harry's mamma thought that would
never do, and she said&mdash;'My son, Nannie's
mamma and I want to talk secrets, and it
is not right for such a little boy as you to
hear them; so take the dear little girl out of
the room, and show her every thing she
wants to see. Mind, dear! <i>show her every
thing</i>.'</p>

<p>"So Harry took Nannie's hand, and led
her out of the room. He felt quite bashful
at first, and when he got into the hall and
had shut the door, he dropped her hand;
and then the two children stood and looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
at each other like two pussy cats on a fence;
only they looked a great deal prettier, because,
you know, neither of them had any
fierce whiskers or long claws. Not they, indeed!
I suppose Harry will have whiskers
one of these days, if he lives to be a man;
but Nannie will never have any, because if
she Jives a thousand years she will never be
a great, rough man, but a beautiful little
woman, which is a great comfort to think of.</p>

<p>"At last Harry said&mdash;'Say, Nannie,
what do you want to see?'</p>

<p>"'I want to tee a 'teamboat.'</p>

<p>"'A steamboat!' exclaimed Harry.</p>

<p>"'Ess, a 'teamboat&mdash;big one!' said little
Nannie.</p>

<p>"Harry looked puzzled; but he took her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hand again, and led her very carefully up
the long flight of stairs, and into every room
on the second floor. They looked under the
beds and into the band-boxes, opened all the
bureau drawers and wardrobe doors, peered
down into the bath-tub, and almost tumbled
in, and couldn't find a steamboat. Then
they went up stairs again, and all over
the rooms in the third story&mdash;no steamboat
there.</p>

<p>"Then they went up stairs again, and all
over the rooms in the top of the house,
opened all the cook's bundles, the waiter's
boxes, the chambermaid's trunk, and the
laundress's umbrella; but not a single steamboat
was to be seen.</p>

<p>"What was poor Harry to do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"He <i>must</i> mind his mamma; and Nannie
kept saying&mdash;'I want to tee a 'teamboat.'</p>

<p>"All of a sudden Harry spied a globe of
the world in one corner of the attic, and he
cried out&mdash;'Here, Nannie, let's look on this
world and see if we can find one.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="200" height="170" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"So down they nestled close together,
and turned the world round and round, but,
strange to tell, there was not a single steamboat
sailing on it. It was really too bad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"They came down stairs again, and then
a bright thought struck Harry&mdash;'Oh, yes!'
he exclaimed, 'I know where a steamboat is.
Dear me! certainly! Come, Nannie, hurry.'</p>

<p>"Down they went to the hall, and Harry
put on his cap, and opened the front door,
and the children went out. Hand in hand
they trotted merrily along, both delighted
to think that at last they were on the track
of a steamboat.</p>

<p>"After walking a long way, they came
to a rough board fence, and Harry peeped
through a knot-hole to see what was inside.
He looked so long, that Nannie cried impatiently&mdash;'Let
me see the 'teamboat.'</p>

<p>"'No, it isn't,' said Harry; 'it's some
boys playing ball. Come and look.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nannie went close to the fence, and
stood on the very tips of her little toes, but
the knot-hole was too high; so Harry lifted
her with all his strength, and she had a fine
time seeing the boys playing ball.</p>

<p>"As he let her come down rather suddenly,
she caught her frock in a splinter of
wood in the fence, and it was torn from top
to bottom. 'Oh, my!' said Nannie, looking
at her dress, 'what a <i>gate</i> hole; oh, my!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, never mind it,' cried Harry, 'that's
nothing;' and he laughed so merrily, that
Nannie thought to tear dresses was great
fun, and laughed too.</p>

<p>"On they went, hand in hand, and every
fence they came to where there were no
houses, they peeped through and searched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
for the steamboat; and they scrambled and
fell against so many rough boards, that Nannie's
pretty little new hat that her kind
grandmamma had just given her, was all bent
and torn and twisted, till from a nice little
round hat, it came to be a queer-looking,
five-cornered one, with one end of ribbon
over her nose, and another sticking out behind;
and the beautiful lace cap inside was
only fit for the rag-bag. Did you ever hear
any thing like it?</p>

<p>"Well, the dear little things wandered
on, Harry knowing that he was minding his
mamma, like a good boy. He was very
happy; because, you know, children that are
obedient and good are never any thing else.
Of course not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"And little Nannie's lovely blue eyes
were very busy looking all over the world
for the steamboat.</p>

<p>"At last they came to an open space&mdash;I
believe, in Seventy-second street, where the
Central Park is; and a very amiable-looking
policeman, who fortunately at that time
was wide awake, happened to look that
way.</p>

<p>"He was very much astonished when he
saw such little creatures all alone; and
Nannie, looking as if she had been in the
wars; but, in spite of her torn dress, looking
like just what she was&mdash;the tender little pet
of a household, watched over, and loved, and
cared for night and day; and Harry, too, it
was plain to see, with his bright eyes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
manly bearing, was of gentle birth and breeding.</p>

<p>"So the policeman walked up to them,
and said&mdash;'I suppose this is Tom Thumb and
his wife out for a walk.'</p>

<p>"'No, it isn't,' said Harry; 'my name is
Harry.'</p>

<p>"'And what is yours, little lady?'</p>

<p>"'My name 'ittle Nannie.'</p>

<p>"'Where did you come from?'</p>

<p>"'Home,' said Harry.</p>

<p>"'Where is home?'</p>

<p>"'Why, in Thirty-second street, to be
sure; don't you know?'</p>

<p>"'Did you run away?' said the policeman.</p>

<p>"'No,' said Harry, and his eyes blazed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with indignation, 'I'm minding mamma; she
told me to show Nannie every thing, and
Nannie wanted to see a steamboat, and I'm
finding one for her now!'</p>

<p>"At this the policeman laughed, and then
he looked so kindly at the children, that I
suspect he had a dozen children of his own at
his house, and that made him love every
other little child. Why, bless your dear little
heart, I love all the little children in the
whole world, because I love you so dearly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE STEAMBOAT HARRY AND EMMA WERE LOOKING FOR.</span>
</div>

<p>"Then the policeman said&mdash;'Well, Harry,
you are a long way from home; and I
think you had better put off the steamboat-hunting
business till some other day. Your
mother may think you and Nannie are a
little too young to travel about the world by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
yourselves. Come; I will go back with
you.'</p>

<p>"It was very fortunate he did, for though
Harry knew very well what street he lived
in, he did not know how to get to it; and it
would have been a sad thing for the dear
little creatures if they had been lost. But
now the good policeman took Nannie in his
arms, because she was getting very tired, and
Harry by the hand, and they all got into a
railroad car, and before long were at the
house.</p>

<p>"But oh! what a distracted house! For
when Nannie's mother had finished the wonderful
secret, and wanted to leave, the children
were not to be found. They searched
the house; they examined the bath-tubs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
wash-tubs; they went out into the garden
and down into the cellar, but they were not
to be found; and then the weeping, terrified
mothers went out into the street, and asked
everybody they met, if they had seen the
children.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="300" height="159" alt="Threatening" title="" />
</div>

<p>"The waiter, who was just setting the
table for dinner, rushed round the corner,
brandishing the carving-knife like a pistol,
and frightened a fashionable young gentleman
out of all his five wits, for he thought it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was a crazy man, trying to kill him; and
when he turned round he was scared again,
for there was the laundress, who had started
out with a wet shirt in her hands, which she
was just starching; there <i>she</i> was, waving it
about in the wind, like a flag of distress, and
crying as hard as she could.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="300" height="143" alt="running" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Then the waiter dropped the carving-knife,
and flew up the street, while the fat
cook, who had left a pudding half-made in
the kitchen, ran after him, dropping her pudding-stick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and wheezing dreadfully; and
away in the distance, they saw the chambermaid,
with the broomstick in her hand, and
her hair all about her ears. She looked so
like a witch, from grief and fright, that as
she disappeared, the people looking after her
were sure she had mounted the broomstick
the very next moment, and had flown over
the tops of the houses.</p>

<p>"Dear me! what a terrible time it was!
But you see they all loved Harry so much,
that they were almost crazy, and that made
them cut up all these didoes.</p>

<p>"All came back lamenting, for no children
had been found; and the distressed mothers
were just writing a note to send to the police-office,
to order the whole city to be searched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
when&mdash;a quick ring at the bell&mdash;Could it
be? Out they all rushed, mothers, cook,
waiter, chambermaid, laundress, the cat, and
the dog. The door was opened, and, oh, joyful
sight! there stood the children and the
policeman, all laughing together.</p>

<p>"No wonder they all screamed and cried,
and laughed and talked, all in a bunch. Nobody
cared a pin for Nannie's torn dress and
five-cornered bonnet, when the darling child
was safe, and hugged tight to her mother's
breast; and Harry and his mother had a
grand kissing time too. Why, dear me!
they almost wanted to kiss the good policeman,
they were so glad; not quite, though;
but they gave him what he thought was
quite astonishing&mdash;something that came out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of a purse, and shone like gold; and between
you and me, it <i>was</i> gold.</p>

<p>"And Harry's mother was not the least
angry with him, when she heard that he was
such a good boy, and was only minding his
mamma when he went all over the world
with Nannie to find a steamboat: no, indeed!
She kissed him again. But let me tell you
as a great secret, that she was very careful
after that to tell Harry to look for steamboats,
or any thing else little girls or he might
want to see, <i>inside</i> of the house; and although
it is many months since this happened,
I know that Harry and Nannie have not
been steamboat-hunting since; but they are
both good, lovely children, and both mind
their mammas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Johnny, "<i>my</i>
story is tip-top! I wish you would read it
right over again, mamma."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, do!" cried all the rest.
"It is <i>so</i> interesting. Dear little Nannie,
she's a darling!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if her grandmother gave her
a new hat," said Minnie. "<i>I</i> would, if <i>I</i> was
her grandmother."</p>

<p>The children laughed at the idea of Minnie's
being a grandmother, and Harry said&mdash;"Come,
sit on my lap, grandmother, and
let me see if you know your letters yet."
Minnie did not like this much, but as Harry
called her his "dear little pet" the next moment,
she forgave him immediately.</p>

<p>"But Aunt Fanny has written something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
else in this letter," said the mother. "Shall
I read it, or repeat the story?"</p>

<p>"Oh! read all the letter <i>this time</i>," cried
the children, "and the story again to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>The little mother read on.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear children, I have
sent you six stories; and if any one will count
the boots and shoes in the first Nightcap
book, they will find that there are the surprising
number of thirteen of you!&mdash;a baker's
dozen.</p>

<p>"Let me see how many are left.</p>

<p>"Minnie and Willie, and Bennie and
Lillie, and dear little Fanny, my <i>namesake,
and Katie and Pet</i>. I think I will write to
this dear little band collectively, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
stories shall make the 'Little Nightcap Letters;'
and the little darlings shall have them
all to themselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! yes! yes! that will be a grand
plan!" cried the children. "Did you ever
hear of such a sensible Aunt Fanny? She
makes it just as we like it."</p>

<p>"If you like this plan," Aunt Fanny goes
on to say, "then the 'Big Nightcap Letters'
are finished with this story sent to Johnny;
and that you will all grow wiser, and better,
and fatter over them, is the loving wish of
your</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Aunt Fanny</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>And so the Big Nightcap Letters were ended;
and the children went off to bed good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
thankful, and content, and rose the next day
good, thankful, and content.</p>

<p>Pray Heaven, dear little reader, you may
always do the same.</p>
